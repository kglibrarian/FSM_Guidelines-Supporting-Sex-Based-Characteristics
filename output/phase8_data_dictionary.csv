Result: Same reference appears 3 times in dataset (once per guideline)

- Can ask: ""How often is this trial cited across guidelines?""
- Can count: ""Guideline A has 150 citations"" (independent of what others cite)

Structure: One row per (guideline, reference, trial) triple  
If reference cites multiple trials:
  - Each NCT gets separate row

WHY: These are genuinely different citations (different papers) that happen to discuss the same trial

DEDUPLICATION_LEVEL_5,Trials Across Guidelines,How same trial cited by multiple guidelines is handled,Methodology,N/A,Phase 3-7: UNIVERSE vs UNIQUE_TRIALS,N/A,N/A,"SAME TRIAL, MULTIPLE GUIDELINES: Depends on analysis level

CITATION-LEVEL Analysis (UNIVERSE - Scenarios S1, S2, S4, S5, S6):
Structure: Keeps all (guideline, reference, trial) relationships
NOT deduplicated across guidelines

If multiple guidelines cite same trial:
  - Guideline A → Reference X → NCT001  
  - Guideline B → Reference Y → NCT001
  - Guideline C → Reference Z → NCT001

Result: 3 rows (same trial, different citation contexts)

WHY: Preserves citation patterns
- Can ask: ""How many times is NCT001 cited?""
- Can ask: ""Which guidelines cite NCT001?""
- Citation is the unit of analysis

EXAMPLE UNIVERSE:
  Row 1: guideline_pmid=12345, ref_pmid=100, ref_primary_nct_number=NCT001
  Row 2: guideline_pmid=23456, ref_pmid=200, ref_primary_nct_number=NCT001
  Row 3: guideline_pmid=34567, ref_pmid=300, ref_primary_nct_number=NCT001
  Total: 3 rows

TRIAL-LEVEL Analysis (UNIQUE_TRIALS - Scenario S3):
Structure: One row per unique NCT (deduplicated)
Deduplicated across all guidelines

Same scenario becomes:
  Row 1: nct_number=NCT001, [keeps most complete data from 3 citations]
  Total: 1 row

WHY: Trial characteristics are the focus
- Can ask: ""How many unique trials are cited?""
- Can ask: ""What % of trials include women?"" (without double-counting)
- Trial is the unit of analysis

DEDUPLICATION KEY (S3): nct_number (or ref_primary_nct_number)
METHOD: drop_duplicates(subset='nct_number', keep='first') after sorting by completeness
WHEN: Phase 7 Step 7 (creates UNIQUE_TRIALS file)

WHICH TO USE?
- UNIVERSE: For guideline behavior analysis (""what do guidelines cite?"")
- UNIQUE_TRIALS: For trial characteristics analysis (""what are properties of cited trials?"")",N/A - Methodology
COUNT_INTERPRETATION_GUIDE,How to Interpret Counts,Quick reference for understanding count meanings,Reference Guide,N/A,Summary of deduplication logic,N/A,N/A,"CITATION COUNTS (UNIVERSE-based scenarios):

""Total citations"" = 9,204
  - Meaning: Total (guideline, reference) pairs
  - Includes: Same reference cited by multiple guidelines (counts each time)
  - Includes: Multiple references from same guideline discussing same trial (counts each reference)
  - Unit: Citation instances
  - Use for: ""How many times are things cited?""

""Unique references"" = ~7,500  
  - Meaning: Unique PMIDs (deduplicated across all guidelines)
  - Removes: Duplicate citations of same PMID by different guidelines
  - Unit: Unique papers
  - Use for: ""How many different papers are cited?""

""Trial citations"" = 1,455 (S1) or 1,600 (S2)
  - Meaning: Citations that are clinical trials (by scenario definition)
  - Includes: Same trial cited multiple times across guidelines
  - Includes: Multiple references discussing same trial
  - Unit: Trial citation instances
  - Use for: ""How many trial citations appear in guidelines?""

TRIAL COUNTS:

""Unique NCTs"" = ~630 (S3)
  - Meaning: Unique ClinicalTrials.gov registry numbers
  - Removes: All duplicates (across guidelines, across references)
  - Unit: Unique trials
  - Use for: ""How many different trials are cited?""

""NCT citations"" = ~630 (S4)
  - Meaning: Citation-trial pairs (UNIVERSE structure)
  - Includes: Same trial cited by different guidelines (separate rows)
  - Includes: Same trial discussed by different references in one guideline (separate rows)
  - Unit: Citation-trial relationships
  - Use for: ""How many citation-trial connections exist?""

GUIDELINE-LEVEL COUNTS:

""Guideline total_citations"" = 150 (example for one guideline)
  - Meaning: Number of (this guideline, reference) pairs
  - Unique within guideline: Same reference counted once per guideline
  - Can overlap across guidelines: If multiple guidelines cite same reference, each counts it
  - Unit: Citations in this guideline
  - Use for: ""How many references does this guideline cite?""

""Guideline trial_citations"" = 45 (example)
  - Meaning: Number of trial citations in this guideline (by scenario definition)
  - Includes: Multiple references discussing same trial (counts each reference)
  - Unit: Trial citations in this guideline
  - Use for: ""How many trial citations does this guideline have?""

""Guideline unique trials"" = 38 (example, if calculated)
  - Meaning: Number of unique NCTs cited by this guideline
  - Removes: Duplicates when multiple references discuss same trial
  - Unit: Unique trials cited by this guideline
  - Use for: ""How many different trials does this guideline cite?""

KEY PRINCIPLE:
- Citation-level (UNIVERSE): Counts relationships (same trial = multiple rows if cited multiple ways)
- Trial-level (UNIQUE_TRIALS): Counts entities (same trial = one row regardless of citations)

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Famous Trial (NCT12345) cited everywhere
  UNIVERSE: Appears 25 times (cited by 25 different guidelines)
  UNIQUE_TRIALS: Appears 1 time (one unique trial)
  Interpretation: Very influential trial (high citation count) but still just one trial

Example 2: Guideline A's trial citations
  Guideline A cites:
    - Reference X → NCT001
    - Reference Y → NCT001 (different paper, same trial)
    - Reference Z → NCT002

  UNIVERSE counts:
    - total_citations for Guideline A = 3 (three references)
    - trial_citations for Guideline A = 3 (all three are trials)
    - Unique trials = 2 (NCT001 and NCT002)

  Interpretation: Guideline cites 3 trial papers, but only 2 unique trials

Example 3: Cross-guideline trial overlap
  Guideline A cites NCT001
  Guideline B cites NCT001

  UNIVERSE:
    - Row 1: guideline_pmid=A, nct=NCT001
    - Row 2: guideline_pmid=B, nct=NCT001
    - Count: 2 citation-trial relationships

  UNIQUE_TRIALS:
    - Row 1: nct=NCT001
    - Count: 1 unique trial

  Interpretation: Two guidelines rely on same trial (important trial for field)",N/A - Reference Guide
