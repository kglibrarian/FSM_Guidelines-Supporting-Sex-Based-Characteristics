1. Symptomatic functional MR (≥3+) due to cardiomyopathy of either ischemic or non-ischemic etiology determined by assessment of a qualifying transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) obtained within 90 days and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) obtained within 180 days prior to subject registration, with MR severity based principally on the TTE study, confirmed by the Echocardiography Core Lab (ECL). The ECL may request a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to confirm MR etiology.

   Note: Functional MR requires the presence of global or regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, which are believed to be the primary cause of the MR. If a flail leaflet or other evidence of degenerative MR is present, the subject is not eligible even if global or regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present.

   Note: Qualifying TTE must be obtained after the subject has been stabilized on optimal therapy including Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) and at least 30 days after:
   1. a greater than 100% increase or greater than 50% decrease in dose of GDMT
   2. revascularization and/or implant of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device (CRT or CRT-D) or reprogramming of an implanted CRT or CRT-D that results in increased biventricular pacing (from \<92% to ≥92%)
2. In the judgment of the HF specialist investigator at the site, the subject has been adequately treated per applicable standards, including for coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation and heart failure (e.g., with cardiac resynchronization therapy, revascularization, and/or GDMT). The Eligibility Committee must also concur that the subject has been adequately treated.
3. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II, III or ambulatory IV.
4. The Local Site Heart Team (CT surgeon and HF specialist investigators) and the Central Eligibility Committee concur that surgery will not be offered as a treatment option and that medical therapy is the intended therapy for the subject, even if the subject is randomized to the Control group.
5. The subject has had at least one hospitalization for heart failure in the 12 months prior to subject registration and/or a corrected brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥300 pg/ml or corrected n-Terminal pro- brain natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP ≥1500 pg/ml measured within 90 days prior to subject registration (""corrected"" refers to a 4% reduction in the BNP or NT-proBNP cutoff for every increase of 1 kg/m2 in BMI above a reference BMI of 20 kg/m2).

   Note: BNP or NT-proBNP must be obtained after the subject has been stabilized on GDMT and at least 30 days after:
   1. a greater than 100% increase or greater than 50% decrease in dose of GDMT
   2. revascularization and/or implant of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device (CRT or CRT-D) or reprogramming of an implanted CRT or CRT-D that results in increased biventricular pacing (from \<92% to ≥92%).
6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) is ≥20% and ≤50% within 90 days prior to subject registration, assessed by the site using any one of the following methods: echocardiography, contrast left ventriculography, gated blood pool scan or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

   Note: The method must provide a quantitative readout (not a visual assessment).
7. The primary regurgitant jet is non-commissural, and in the opinion of the MitraClip implanting investigator can be successfully be treated by the MitraClip. If a secondary jet exists, it must be considered clinically insignificant.
8. Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB) obtained within prior 14 days \< local laboratory Upper Limit of Normal (ULN).
9. Transseptal catheterization and femoral vein access is determined to be feasible by the MitraClip implanting investigator.

11. The subject or the subject's legal representative understands and agrees that should he/she be assigned to the Control group, he/she will be treated with medical therapy and conservative management without surgery and without the MitraClip, either domestically or abroad. If the subject would actively contemplate surgery and/or MitraClip if randomized to Control, he/she should not be registered in this trial.
12. The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the trial and agrees to its provisions, including the possibility of randomization to the Control group and returning for all required post-procedure follow-up visits, and has provided written informed consent.
13. Left Ventricular End Systolic Dimension (LVESD) is ≤ 70 mm assessed by site based on a transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) obtained within 90 days prior to subject registration.

Patients will be eligible for the study if, in the opinion of the treating clinician, they continue to require mechanical ventilation only because their degree of agitation requires such a high dose of sedative medication (midazolam or propofol, the only commonly used specific sedatives in our unit) that extubation is not possible, AND in the opinion of their treating intensivist their agitation is so severe as to make lessening their sedation unsafe.

These criteria will be objectively quantified as follows:

* they have required either mechanical restraint and/or anti-delirium or sedative medication in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent AND
* their Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) test is positive for delirium in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent AND
* their Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS) score is 5 or more in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent, confirming psychomotor agitation AND

  2. electrocardiographic documentation of 1 persistent AF episode: (sustained for ≥7 days or cardioversion is performed more than 48h after AF onset): or
  3. electrocardiographic documentation of 1 longstanding persistent AF episode: (continuous AF of duration \>1 year).
* Warrant active therapy (within the past 3 months) beyond simple ongoing observation
* Be eligible for catheter ablation and ≥2 sequential rhythm control and/or ≥2 rate control drugs.
* Be ≥65 yrs of age, or \<65 yrs with one or more of the following risk factors for stroke: Hypertension (treated and/or defined as a blood pressure \>140/90 mmHg) \[90\], Diabetes (treated and/or defined as a fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dl) \[91\], Congestive heart failure (including systolic or diastolic heart failure), Prior stroke, transient ischemic attack or systemic emboli, Atherosclerotic vascular disease (previous myocardial infarction (MI), peripheral arterial disease or aortic plaque), left atrial (LA) size \>5.0 cm (or volume index ≥40 cc/m2), or ejection fraction (EF) ≤35.
* Have the capacity to understand and sign an informed consent form.
* Be ≥18 years of age.

  * NOTE- Subjects \<65 yrs of age whose only risk factor is hypertension must have a second risk factor or left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy to qualify.Patients receiving new drug therapy initiated within the previous 3 months may continue that therapy if randomized to the drug therapy arm.

* Recent cardiac events including MI, percutaneous intervention (PCI), or valve or bypass surgery in the preceding 3 months
* Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (outflow track)
* Class IV angina or Class IV congestive heart failure (CHF) (including past or planned heart transplantation)
