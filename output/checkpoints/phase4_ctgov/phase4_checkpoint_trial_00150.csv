1. Symptomatic functional MR (≥3+) due to cardiomyopathy of either ischemic or non-ischemic etiology determined by assessment of a qualifying transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) obtained within 90 days and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) obtained within 180 days prior to subject registration, with MR severity based principally on the TTE study, confirmed by the Echocardiography Core Lab (ECL). The ECL may request a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to confirm MR etiology.

   Note: Functional MR requires the presence of global or regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, which are believed to be the primary cause of the MR. If a flail leaflet or other evidence of degenerative MR is present, the subject is not eligible even if global or regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present.

   Note: Qualifying TTE must be obtained after the subject has been stabilized on optimal therapy including Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) and at least 30 days after:
   1. a greater than 100% increase or greater than 50% decrease in dose of GDMT
   2. revascularization and/or implant of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device (CRT or CRT-D) or reprogramming of an implanted CRT or CRT-D that results in increased biventricular pacing (from \<92% to ≥92%)
2. In the judgment of the HF specialist investigator at the site, the subject has been adequately treated per applicable standards, including for coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation and heart failure (e.g., with cardiac resynchronization therapy, revascularization, and/or GDMT). The Eligibility Committee must also concur that the subject has been adequately treated.
3. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II, III or ambulatory IV.
4. The Local Site Heart Team (CT surgeon and HF specialist investigators) and the Central Eligibility Committee concur that surgery will not be offered as a treatment option and that medical therapy is the intended therapy for the subject, even if the subject is randomized to the Control group.

The subject has had at least one hospitalization for heart failure in the 12 months prior to subject registration and/or a corrected brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥300 pg/ml or corrected n-Terminal pro- brain natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP ≥1500 pg/ml measured within 90 days prior to subject registration (""corrected"" refers to a 4% reduction in the BNP or NT-proBNP cutoff for every increase of 1 kg/m2 in BMI above a reference BMI of 20 kg/m2).

   Note: BNP or NT-proBNP must be obtained after the subject has been stabilized on GDMT and at least 30 days after:
   1. a greater than 100% increase or greater than 50% decrease in dose of GDMT
   2. revascularization and/or implant of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device (CRT or CRT-D) or reprogramming of an implanted CRT or CRT-D that results in increased biventricular pacing (from \<92% to ≥92%).
6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) is ≥20% and ≤50% within 90 days prior to subject registration, assessed by the site using any one of the following methods: echocardiography, contrast left ventriculography, gated blood pool scan or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

   Note: The method must provide a quantitative readout (not a visual assessment).
7. The primary regurgitant jet is non-commissural, and in the opinion of the MitraClip implanting investigator can be successfully be treated by the MitraClip. If a secondary jet exists, it must be considered clinically insignificant.

Patients will be eligible for the study if, in the opinion of the treating clinician, they continue to require mechanical ventilation only because their degree of agitation requires such a high dose of sedative medication (midazolam or propofol, the only commonly used specific sedatives in our unit) that extubation is not possible, AND in the opinion of their treating intensivist their agitation is so severe as to make lessening their sedation unsafe.

These criteria will be objectively quantified as follows:

* they have required either mechanical restraint and/or anti-delirium or sedative medication in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent AND
* their Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) test is positive for delirium in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent AND
* their Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS) score is 5 or more in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent, confirming psychomotor agitation AND

12. Lower extremity revascularization in the last three months or major orthopedic surgery during the previous three months.
13. Myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary artery bypass grafting during the previous 3 months.
14. Major medical illnesses including end stage renal disease requiring dialysis and chronic lung disease requiring oxygen, since these individuals may not be able to adhere to study requirements. Participants who only use oxygen at night may still qualify.
15. Potential participants who have received G-CSF, GM-CSF, or erythropoietin within the past year will be excluded because these interventions may influence study outcomes independently of the interventions.
16. Pre-menopausal women will be excluded because cyclic estrogen changes can influence progenitor cell levels.
17. Potential participants with diabetes and documented proliferative retinopathy will be excluded because GM-CSF may exacerbate this condition.
18. Potential participants with a history of myeloid malignancy will be excluded because GM-CSF may exacerbate these conditions.
19. Potential participants who have been treated for late stage cancer during the past three years, since GM-CSF may theoretically activate quiescent cancer cells.
20. Planned lower extremity revascularization within the next 6 months.
21. Current participation in another clinical trial. If a participant recently completed a clinical trial, at least three months must have passed before they can be considered for the PROPEL Trial. However, for a clinical trial of stem cell or gene therapy intervention, potential participants will be potentially eligible immediately after the final study visit of the stem cell or gene therapy clinical trial, so long as at least six months has passed since the participant received their final treatment in the stem cell or gene therapy intervention.
22. Walking for exercise at a level comparable to that targeted in our intervention.
23. Current participation in or completion of a cardiac rehabilitation program within the last six months.

    The following exclusion criteria will be assessed at the time of the study visit or later:
24. Severe aortic stenosis identified by physical exam at the study visit.
25. Critical limb ischemia identified by physical exam at the study visit.
26. Coronary ischemia during exercise, defined as ST segment depression \> 1 mm during the baseline exercise treadmill test, with or without associated chest discomfort, without a perfusion stress test demonstrating no reversible ischemia within the previous 3 months.
27. Left-bundle branch block or significant ST-T wave changes on the baseline ECG without a perfusion stress test demonstrating no reversible ischemia within the previous 3 months.
28. Stopping during the treadmill stress test for shortness of breath, chest pain, hip pain, knee pain, or another symptom that may not represent ischemic leg pain.
29. Stopping during the six-minute walk test for symptoms other than ischemic leg symptoms.
30. Foot ulcer identified at the study visit.
31. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score \< 23 or disabling psychiatric disease.
32. Failure to complete a study run-in period.
