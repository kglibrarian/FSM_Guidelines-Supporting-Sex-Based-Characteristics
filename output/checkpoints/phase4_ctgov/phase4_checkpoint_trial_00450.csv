1. Symptomatic functional MR (≥3+) due to cardiomyopathy of either ischemic or non-ischemic etiology determined by assessment of a qualifying transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) obtained within 90 days and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) obtained within 180 days prior to subject registration, with MR severity based principally on the TTE study, confirmed by the Echocardiography Core Lab (ECL). The ECL may request a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to confirm MR etiology.

   Note: Functional MR requires the presence of global or regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, which are believed to be the primary cause of the MR. If a flail leaflet or other evidence of degenerative MR is present, the subject is not eligible even if global or regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is present.

   Note: Qualifying TTE must be obtained after the subject has been stabilized on optimal therapy including Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) and at least 30 days after:
   1. a greater than 100% increase or greater than 50% decrease in dose of GDMT
   2. revascularization and/or implant of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device (CRT or CRT-D) or reprogramming of an implanted CRT or CRT-D that results in increased biventricular pacing (from \<92% to ≥92%)
2. In the judgment of the HF specialist investigator at the site, the subject has been adequately treated per applicable standards, including for coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation and heart failure (e.g., with cardiac resynchronization therapy, revascularization, and/or GDMT). The Eligibility Committee must also concur that the subject has been adequately treated.
3. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II, III or ambulatory IV.
4. The Local Site Heart Team (CT surgeon and HF specialist investigators) and the Central Eligibility Committee concur that surgery will not be offered as a treatment option and that medical therapy is the intended therapy for the subject, even if the subject is randomized to the Control group.

The subject has had at least one hospitalization for heart failure in the 12 months prior to subject registration and/or a corrected brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥300 pg/ml or corrected n-Terminal pro- brain natriuretic peptide NT-proBNP ≥1500 pg/ml measured within 90 days prior to subject registration (""corrected"" refers to a 4% reduction in the BNP or NT-proBNP cutoff for every increase of 1 kg/m2 in BMI above a reference BMI of 20 kg/m2).

   Note: BNP or NT-proBNP must be obtained after the subject has been stabilized on GDMT and at least 30 days after:
   1. a greater than 100% increase or greater than 50% decrease in dose of GDMT
   2. revascularization and/or implant of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy device (CRT or CRT-D) or reprogramming of an implanted CRT or CRT-D that results in increased biventricular pacing (from \<92% to ≥92%).
6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) is ≥20% and ≤50% within 90 days prior to subject registration, assessed by the site using any one of the following methods: echocardiography, contrast left ventriculography, gated blood pool scan or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

   Note: The method must provide a quantitative readout (not a visual assessment).
7. The primary regurgitant jet is non-commissural, and in the opinion of the MitraClip implanting investigator can be successfully be treated by the MitraClip. If a secondary jet exists, it must be considered clinically insignificant.

Patients will be eligible for the study if, in the opinion of the treating clinician, they continue to require mechanical ventilation only because their degree of agitation requires such a high dose of sedative medication (midazolam or propofol, the only commonly used specific sedatives in our unit) that extubation is not possible, AND in the opinion of their treating intensivist their agitation is so severe as to make lessening their sedation unsafe.

These criteria will be objectively quantified as follows:

* they have required either mechanical restraint and/or anti-delirium or sedative medication in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent AND
* their Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) test is positive for delirium in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent AND
* their Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS) score is 5 or more in the 4 hours prior to seeking consent, confirming psychomotor agitation AND

12. Lower extremity revascularization in the last three months or major orthopedic surgery during the previous three months.
13. Myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary artery bypass grafting during the previous 3 months.
14. Major medical illnesses including end stage renal disease requiring dialysis and chronic lung disease requiring oxygen, since these individuals may not be able to adhere to study requirements. Participants who only use oxygen at night may still qualify.
15. Potential participants who have received G-CSF, GM-CSF, or erythropoietin within the past year will be excluded because these interventions may influence study outcomes independently of the interventions.
16. Pre-menopausal women will be excluded because cyclic estrogen changes can influence progenitor cell levels.
17. Potential participants with diabetes and documented proliferative retinopathy will be excluded because GM-CSF may exacerbate this condition.
18. Potential participants with a history of myeloid malignancy will be excluded because GM-CSF may exacerbate these conditions.
19. Potential participants who have been treated for late stage cancer during the past three years, since GM-CSF may theoretically activate quiescent cancer cells.
20. Planned lower extremity revascularization within the next 6 months.
21. Current participation in another clinical trial. If a participant recently completed a clinical trial, at least three months must have passed before they can be considered for the PROPEL Trial. However, for a clinical trial of stem cell or gene therapy intervention, potential participants will be potentially eligible immediately after the final study visit of the stem cell or gene therapy clinical trial, so long as at least six months has passed since the participant received their final treatment in the stem cell or gene therapy intervention.
22. Walking for exercise at a level comparable to that targeted in our intervention.
23. Current participation in or completion of a cardiac rehabilitation program within the last six months.

    The following exclusion criteria will be assessed at the time of the study visit or later:
24. Severe aortic stenosis identified by physical exam at the study visit.
25. Critical limb ischemia identified by physical exam at the study visit.
26. Coronary ischemia during exercise, defined as ST segment depression \> 1 mm during the baseline exercise treadmill test, with or without associated chest discomfort, without a perfusion stress test demonstrating no reversible ischemia within the previous 3 months.
27. Left-bundle branch block or significant ST-T wave changes on the baseline ECG without a perfusion stress test demonstrating no reversible ischemia within the previous 3 months.
28. Stopping during the treadmill stress test for shortness of breath, chest pain, hip pain, knee pain, or another symptom that may not represent ischemic leg pain.
29. Stopping during the six-minute walk test for symptoms other than ischemic leg symptoms.
30. Foot ulcer identified at the study visit.
31. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score \< 23 or disabling psychiatric disease.
32. Failure to complete a study run-in period.

5. Has a telephone

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Currently walking for exercise at least 5 days per week (i.e., a PACE score ranging from 5-8); the rationale is that a person who is currently walking for at least 5 days per week is already sufficiently active and therefore not a member of the target population for our motivational home-based walking intervention.

4. Leg revascularization within 3 months of enrollment or plans for revascularization during the study period; the rationale is that post intervention recovery and potential complications are likely to limit the patient's ability to adhere to the study protocol.
5. Use of supplemental oxygen; the rationale for this is concern for participant safety and potential limited ability to participate in the study secondary to breathing difficulty.
6. Myocardial infarction within the preceding 3 months; the rationale for this is participant safety and the potential risk for complications and/or the need for supervised cardiac rehabilitation following the event.
7. Resting blood pressure \> 200/110 mmHg; the rationale for this is participant safety, as blood pressure may further increase during exercise and increase risk for a cerebrovascular event or myocardial infarction.
8. Exercise-induced coronary ischemic symptoms, or exercise-induced ST depression \> 2.0 mm; the rationale for this is participant safety and the need for further cardiac evaluation prior to involvement in walking therapy (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, 2006).
9. Inability to walk for 2 minutes; the rationale being that people who cannot walk for 2 minutes would not be able to complete the necessary submaximal treadmill test, which is used to screen for coronary ischemic symptoms.

Anyone who can complete the submaximal test would not have significant walking impairment and would not get that much out of the study.

For example, the patient must not have \>2 lesions requiring treatment within both the LAD and a diagonal branch in total.
   * If there are two target lesions within the same epicardial vessel, the two target lesions must be at least 15 mm apart per visual estimation; otherwise this is considered as a single target lesion.
2. Target lesion ≤ 32 mm in length by visual estimation.
3. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated reference vessel diameter between 2.25 mm and 4.25 mm.
4. Exclusive use of XIENCE family of stent systems during the index procedure.

3. Subject with implantation of another drug-eluting stent (other than XIENCE) within 9 months prior to index procedure.
4. Subject has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \<30%.
5. Subject judged by physician as inappropriate for discontinuation from P2Y12 inhibitor use at 3 months, due to another condition requiring chronic P2Y12 inhibitor use.
6. Subject with planned surgery or procedure necessitating discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor within 3 months following index procedure.
7. Subject with a current medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.
8. Subject intends to participate in an investigational drug or device trial within 12 months following the index procedure.
9. Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year following index procedure. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site standard test.

   Note: Female patients of childbearing potential should be instructed to use safe contraception (e.g., intrauterine devices, hormonal contraceptives: contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices, injections with prolonged release.) It is accepted, in certain cases, to include subjects having a sterilised regular partner or subjects using a double barrier contraceptive method. However, this should be explicitly justified in special circumstances arising from the study design, product characteristics and/or study population
10. Subject is part of a vulnerable population, defined as subject whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation or of retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. Examples of populations which may contain vulnerable subjects include: individuals with lack of or loss of autonomy due to immaturity or through mental disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished persons, subjects in emergency situations, ethnic minority groups, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those incapable of giving informed consent. Other vulnerable subjects include, for example, members of a group with a hierarchical structure such as university students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the sponsor, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention.
11. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet completed its primary endpoint.

Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

1. Target lesion is in a left main location.
2. Target lesion is located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft.
3. Target lesion is restenotic from a previous stent implantation.
4. Target lesion is a total occluded lesion (TIMI flow 0).
5. Target lesion contains thrombus as indicated in the angiographic images (per SYNTAX score thrombus definition).
6. Target lesion is implanted with overlapping stents, whether planned or for bailout.

1. Male or female children from birth through 17 years of age with chronic symptomatic CHF due to systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction who are receiving standard heart failure therapy will be eligible. Since adolescents with left ventricular dysfunction are very similar to adults with this disease, this study will focus recruitment in the prepubertal age group of children, including children from birth through Tanner Stage 3. The number of adolescents enrolled will be limited to approximately 10% of study enrollment. However, teenagers with single ventricles or morphologic right ventricles as systemic ventricles represent an important population that is unique to pediatric cardiology. The 10% limitation will only apply to teenagers who have dilated cardiomyopathies since these patients may be similar to young adults with dilated cardiomyopathies. Adolescents will be defined as Tanner Stage 4 through age 17.
2. A diagnosis of CHF by NYHA Class II-IV (generally, children older than 5 years of age) or Ross' classification of CHF Class II-IV (12) (generally, children less than 5 years old) for at least 1 month (at least 2 weeks, for neonates) prior to screening.
3. An estimated ejection fraction less than 40% in patients with systemic left ventricular dysfunction or qualitative evidence of a dilated ventricle with moderate systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with right ventricular or single ventricular physiology, documented within 4 weeks of randomization. Patients may be enrolled based on these criteria as determined by the site. However, all echocardiograms will be reviewed and interpreted by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at the University of Utah. Upon subsequent review by the DCC, if it is determined that either the ejection fraction is greater than or equal to 40% or the ventricular function is not moderate to severely decreased, patients will be enrolled. However, their data analysis will be based upon the findings from the DCC at the University of Utah.
4. The etiology of the cardiomyopathy will include idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, post-viral myocarditis cardiomyopathy, anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiomyopathies (e.g., Kawasaki's disease, repaired anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery, d-TGA s/p arterial switch), cardiomyopathies associated with single ventricle with ventricular systolic dysfunction, corrected transposition, etc. Excluded from enrollment will be dilated cardiomyopathies secondary to muscular dystrophies, hemoglobinopathies, HIV, carnitine deficiency, and systemic ventricular dysfunction due to ventricular outflow obstruction.
5. Patients undergoing treatment for CHF with standard CHF therapy, such as diuretic, digoxin and ACE inhibitors. All patients should be receiving ACE inhibitors prior to enrollment in this study unless contraindicated or intolerant. If intolerance has been established, the patient must have been withdrawn from these drugs for at least one month prior to randomization. Other medications such as hydralazine, nitrates or amiodarone may also be used. Therapy with amiodarone should not have started or stopped within 2 months of randomization.
6. All patients should be receiving diuretics prior to enrollment in this study unless contraindicated or intolerant. Patients must be in optimal fluid status prior to enrollment.
7. Patients must be receiving a stable regimen of standard CHF medications for a period of at least one month (2 weeks in neonates) at the time of randomization into the study.

Patients with any of the following will be excluded from the study:

1. NYHA or Ross' CHF Classification Class I (asymptomatic).
2. Patients actively listed for transplantation at time of entry into the study or anticipated to undergo heart transplantation or corrective heart surgery during the 8 months following entry into the study. However, those patients in whom listing for transplantation is anticipated but may be waiting a long period of time (greater than 8 months), such as Status 2 patients, may be considered for enrollment in this study.
3. Sustained or symptomatic ventricular dysrhythmias uncontrolled by drug therapy or the use of an implantable defibrillator, and/or significant cardiac conduction defects, e.g., 2nd degree or 3rd degree AV block, or sick sinus syndrome, unless a functioning pacemaker is in place.
4. Uncorrected primary obstructive or severe regurgitative valvular disease, nondilated (restrictive) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or significant systemic ventricular outflow obstruction.
5. Dilated cardiomyopathies secondary to muscular dystrophies, hemoglobinopathies, HIV, carnitine deficiency, and systemic ventricular dysfunction due to ventricular outflow obstruction.
6. Active myocarditis.
7. Unacceptable blood pressures and heart rates. Sitting (supine in infants) systolic blood pressure must be \> 85 mm Hg in teens, \> 75 mm Hg in school-aged children, and \> 65 mm Hg in infants (12). Resting heart rate must be greater than the 2nd percentile for age (13).
8. Renovascular hypertension or evidence of pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular resistance index \> 6 Wood units-m2) unresponsive to vasodilator agents such as oxygen, nitroprusside, or nitric oxide.
9. History or current clinical evidence of moderate-to-severe obstructive pulmonary disease or reactive airway diseases (e.g., asthma) requiring therapy.
10. Significant renal (serum creatinine \>2.0), hepatic (serum AST and/or ALT \> 3 times upper limit of normal), gastrointestinal, or biliary disorders that could impair absorption, metabolism, or excretion of orally administered medications.
11. Concurrent terminal illness or other severe disease (e.g., active neoplasm) or other significant laboratory value(s) which, in the opinion of the investigator, could preclude participation or survival.

* STRATUM II: Among leukemia and lymphoma patients randomized to + or - DRZ on P9404, P9425, P9426, and DFCI 95-01 (high risk patients only) who have relapsed or have experienced a subsequent malignancy that precludes eligibility since their original diagnosis, the study committee will review the available data (both from Children's Oncology Group's \[COG?s\] Statistics and Data Center \[SDC\] and the participating institution) to determine if individual patients are to be selected for Stratum 2; in recognition that local institutions sometimes have more updated relapse/subsequent cancer data than SDC, in cases where local data is more updated, local data will be used preferentially; the study will petition the Institutional Review Board (IRB) specifically for a waiver of consent to include any relapse and subsequent cancer data obtained from existing records for analysis of the secondary aims; patients selected for Stratum 2 will be those for whom late relapse or subsequent cancer is reported but who lack clear confirmation in existing records (either at SDC or at the local institution)
* STRATUM II: Alive, but have experienced relapse of their original cancer and/or have developed a subsequent cancer (other than non-melanomatous skin cancer) since their original diagnosis
* STRATUM II: All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent
* STRATUM III: OSTEOSARCOMA SURVIVORS
* Previously enrolled osteosarcoma survivors treated on P9754 who are alive and able (themselves and/or parents/legal guardian) to provide written informed consent; note that relapse and subsequent malignancy are not exclusion criteria for P9754 survivors
* Comparison subjects for P9754 survivors will be eligible to be enrolled from any ALTE11C2 participating COG site (even if that institution did not participate on P9754), according to the following criteria:

  * Newly diagnosed, previously untreated biopsy-proven moderate or high grade osteosarcoma without metastasis; patients with low grade osteosarcoma, parosteal or periosteal sarcoma are ineligible
  * \< 31 years of age at time of initial osteosarcoma diagnosis
  * Diagnosis occurred between January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2002; duration of therapy can extend beyond 2002
  * No evidence of poor or low cardiac function at time of initial osteosarcoma diagnosis; if reports from the time are available: shortening fraction \>= 28% by echocardiogram and within the institutional normative range for age, or radionuclide angiogram ejection fraction \>= 50%; if imaging reports from the time are no longer available, there must be no documentation within available medical records that suggest poor or low cardiac function at time of diagnosis
  * Comparison subject must have institutional records (e.g., clinic note, treatment summary, chemotherapy roadmap) documenting lifetime receipt of 450 to 600 mg/m\^2 of doxorubicin (doses within 10% are acceptable); this includes initial therapy as well as any subsequent therapy for relapse or second cancer, if relevant; as such, comparison subjects who have had osteosarcoma relapse or subsequent malignancies remain eligible so long as they meet all other eligibility criteria
  * No anthracycline or anthraquinone aside from doxorubicin was ever given as part of initial or subsequent therapies
  * No exposure to DRZ at any point in time
  * All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent
* STRATUM IV: CARDIOMYOPATHY CASES, NOT OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR STRATUMS 1, 2, AND 3
* Individuals diagnosed with cancer prior to age 21 years, who required treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, achieved initial remission, and remained alive after completing anti-cancer-therapy for at least 1 year
* Must have screening echocardiograms for heart function as part of cancer therapy and off-therapy evaluations available (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine \[DICOM\] format). Images from Video Home System (VHS) tapes and reports only (without images) are not suitable
* Cannot have a known history of congenital heart disease (patent foramen ovale remain eligible) or underlying genetic syndrome associated with abnormal cardiovascular development or health (e.g., down syndrome)
* Based on echocardiography, must have either left ventricular fractional shortening =\< 28.0% or ejection fraction =\< 50.0% on at least two occasions, with at least one of these measurements occurring after cancer therapy completion and be in the absence of sepsis or any uncontrolled infection
* If the fractional shortening or ejection fraction criteria is only met on one occasion, this must be after cancer therapy completion, be in the absence of sepsis or any uncontrolled infection, and the patient must have subsequently started on chronic medical therapy for cardiomyopathy (e.g., beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme \[ACE\]-inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker) lasting at least 6 months
* For all participants (stratums 1, 2, 3, and 4), all institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met",ALL,,,False,"[{""type"": ""OTHER"", ""name"": ""Assessment of Therapy Complications"", ""description"": ""Ancillary studies"", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Ancillary-Correlative (laboratory biomarker analysis)""]}, {""type"": ""OTHER"", ""name"": ""Laboratory Biomarker Analysis"", ""description"": ""Correlative studies"", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Ancillary-Correlative (laboratory biomarker analysis)""]}, {""type"": ""OTHER"", ""name"": ""Quality-of-Life Assessment"", ""description"": ""Ancillary studies"", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Ancillary-Correlative (laboratory biomarker analysis)""], ""otherNames"": [""Quality of Life Assessment""]}, {""type"": ""OTHER"", ""name"": ""Questionnaire Administration"", ""description"": ""Ancillary studies"", ""armGroupLabels"": [""Ancillary-Correlative (laboratory biomarker analysis)""]}]",OTHER: Assessment of Therapy Complications; OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis; OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment; OTHER: Questionnaire Administration,"Left ventricular function and measures of pathologic remodeling (i.e., thickness-to-dimension ratio) assessed using standard 2-dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler echocardiogram; Differences in serum biomarkers (particularly cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides)",Quality of life based on self-report instruments; Primary disease relapse; Second cancer rates; Longitudinal trajectory of 2-dimensional echocardiographic parameters,"Birmingham, United States; Phoenix, United States; Tucson, United States; Little Rock, United States; Duarte, United States; Madera, United States; Oakland, United States; Palo Alto, United States; San Diego, United States; New Haven, United States; Fort Myers, United States; Gainesville, United States; Hollywood, United States; Jacksonville, United States; Orlando, United States; St. Petersburg, United States; Tampa, United States; West Palm Beach, United States; Atlanta, United States; Honolulu, United States; Honolulu, United States; Chicago, United States; Chicago, United States; Oak Lawn, United States; Peoria, United States; New Orleans, United States; Scarborough, United States; Baltimore, United States; Baltimore, United States; Boston, United States; Detroit, United States; Detroit, United States; Flint, United States; Jackson, United States; Columbia, United States; St Louis, United States; Las Vegas, United States; Las Vegas, United States; Las Vegas, United States; Las Vegas, United States; Lebanon, United States; Hackensack, United States; Albuquerque, United States; Buffalo, United States; New Hyde Park, United States; Rochester, United States; Stony Brook, United States; Syracuse, United States; Asheville, United States; Winston-Salem, United States; Akron, United States; Cincinnati, United States; Oklahoma City, United States; Portland, United States; Portland, United States; Philadelphia, United States; Providence, United States; Charleston, United States; Greenville, United States; Dallas, United States; Dallas, United States; Fort Worth, United States; Houston, United States; San Antonio, United States; Burlington, United States; Richmond, United States; Seattle, United States; Spokane, United States; Milwaukee, United States; Perth, Australia; Perth, Australia; Calgary, Canada; Hamilton, Canada; Ottawa, Canada; Toronto, Canada; Montreal, Canada; Montreal, Canada; Québec, Canada; San Juan, Puerto Rico",79,SUCCESS,2025-12-22T14:26:53.569996

1. Mothers must have anti-Ro and/or anti-La Ab documented in the NYU immunology laboratory (CLIA-approved), which utilizes an ELISA as well as reactivity on ELISA to at least one of three recombinant antigens (48La, 52Ro, 60Ro, JB laboratory).
2. Mothers must have a previous child with cardiac NL, defined herein as: the presence of heart block (1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree) documented by electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram, pacemaker, or statement in the medical record, and/or; presence of cardiac injury, which specifically includes autopsy evidence of a mononuclear infiltrate in the endocardium, myocardium, and pericardium and/or EFE on echocardiogram always associated with cardiac dysfunction. In PITCH, we included women with a prior child with rash; however, recent data generated from the RRNL suggest that recurrence of CHB following rash is 11%, not 18% \[34\]. Thus, inclusion of previous rash could lead to a falsely lowered recurrence rate, and will therefore be excluded.
3. Intrauterine pregnancy ≤10 weeks.
4. Mother may be taking ≤20 mg prednisone because, in our experience, CHB has developed in the presence of this dose.
5. Mother may be asymptomatic, or have a rheumatic disease such as SLE or SS. Maternal health status has not been considered an influence on the development of CHB.
6. Mother may or may not already be taking HCQ. This latter point was discussed with Dr. Nathalie Costedoat-Chalumeau, who has published extensively on measurement of HCQ. While it might be optimal for the mothers anticipating enrollment in the study to all have been on HCQ prior to conception, this is impractical. Some may never achieve pregnancy and not want to take HCQ unless they conceive (especially those asymptomatic). On the other hand, women with SLE are likely to already be on HCQ and it would limit enrollment to exclude these patients if all must initiate HCQ only at enrollment in the first trimester. Although the accepted dogma is that HCQ requires several months for maximal efficacy in treating rheumatic disease, it is unknown whether this would apply to transplacental passage or fetal levels (which are impossible to measure). Dr. Costedoat-Chalumeau suggests that HCQ is probably a three compartment model which includes the circulation, tissues and cells. In the circulation, the half life is approximately 7 days and in the tissues, it is 40 days. In Dr. Costedoat-Chalumeau's experience, steady state blood levels of HCQ are achieved in 4-6 weeks. Thus, dosing the mother no later than 10 weeks gestation should provide sufficient fetal exposure before the vulnerable period of CHB which is generally accepted to span 18-24 wks. Furthermore, the placenta has to be formed for HCQ to gain access to the fetus and it may be effective quickly for the biology we are considering.

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Mother does not have Ab to Ro or La.
2. Identification of any of the following structural lesions considered causal for CHB, i.e., those that could account for block because of fibrous disruption between the atrium and AV node or due to absence of the penetrating bundles of the AV node:

   * atrioventricular septal defects;
   * b) single ventricle
   * c) developmental tricuspid valve disease;
   * d) L-transposition of the great arteries;
   * e) heterotaxia.
3. Mother is taking any glucocorticoids. Although unlikely to be preventative, the use of steroids may confound the interpretation of results. The final point of intense discussion centered around whether another exclusion should be the use of HCQ in the first pregnancy in which CHB occurred. While one could argue that in these mothers HCQ was not effective and perhaps will not be again, this assumption remains speculative and thus prior absence of efficacy of HCQ will not constitute an exclusion criteria.",FEMALE,18 Years,45 Years,False,"[{""type"": ""DRUG"", ""name"": ""Hydroxychloroquine"", ""description"": ""Nineteen women meeting eligibility criteria will receive 400mg per day of HCQ beginning as soon as pregnancy is established and informed consent obtained.
