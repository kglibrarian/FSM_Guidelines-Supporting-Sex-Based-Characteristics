Massive ingestions can result in severe toxicity and even death. We describe a case of diphenhydramine overdose leading to cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cannulation for refractory ventricular fibrillation, a process we refer to as extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). Responding to a call for altered mental status, emergency medical service (EMS) personnel found an unconscious and seizing 17-year-old male. He had reportedly developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures and dysrhythmias after ingesting approximately 800 25-mg diphenhydramine tablets. He was transferred to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after stabilization at a local emergency center. After approximately 7 hours of clinical stability and normalization of cardiac rhythm, electrolytes, and acidosis, he developed renewed seizure activity and accelerated ventricular rhythm leading to hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest. He was cannulated for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) with CPR in progress. A pharmacobezoar located in his stomach was presumed to be the cause of his biphasic clinical deterioration. After 5 days, the patient was successfully weaned from ECMO support. Ten days later, his convalescence continued in the step-down unit and was discharged with good functional outcome. Significant ingestion of anticholinergic substances is often fatal. This case describes a favorable outcome after ECPR and aggressive supportive management following a large intentional overdose of diphenhydramine.",success

We sought to characterize the abuse of bupropion via insufflation in cases reported to the California Poison Control System (CPCS) and the incidence of seizures. An 11-year (2002-2012) retrospective observational case series of insufflated bupropion exposures evaluated in a health care facility (HCF) were reviewed after searching our database for all bupropion insufflation exposures. Patients with coingestants, multiple exposure routes, or age less than 18 were excluded. Data included age, gender, estimated bupropion dose, occurrence of pre-HCF seizures, symptoms and vital signs reported to the CPCS, treatments, and adverse events that occurred until time of discharge. 74 cases were identified (1 excluded due to age, 5 excluded due to additional oral ingestion of bupropion, and 1 excluded due to being unable to follow). A total of 67 cases met inclusion criteria. The median age was 36 (range, 18-65) years. The total dose of bupropion insufflated was reported in 52 pts; median dose of 1500 (range, 100-9000) mg. Eighteen cases (27%) involved staggered or chronic exposures. Of the 67 patients, 20 (30%) experienced a seizure prior to arrival at the HCF. Of these, 19 patients (95%) presented with tachycardia. None of these patients had a second seizure in the emergency department. There were no major medical outcomes and no deaths. Of the 67 patients, 9 patients received benzodiazepines and 6 patients received single-dose activated charcoal. The abuse of bupropion by crushing and insufflating through the nose is uncommon (67/2270 or 3.0%) compared with that by oral bupropion exposures reported to CPCS.

During a mean of 4.55 (±2.33) years of follow-up, 1000 patients died. Using Cox regression for proportional odds and taking a wide range of potential confounders into consideration, participation in exCR was related to significantly lower total mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.62-0.83]. Excluding patients with shorter follow-up than 2 years did not alter the results. Exercise-based CR participation was related to lowered total mortality in most of the investigated subgroups. The risk reduction was more pronounced in women than in men (HR 0.54 vs. 0.81, respectively).

Measures included age, sex, educational attainment, smoking status, medical diagnosis, ejection fraction, and electronic referral to CR. Data included General Anxiety Disorder, Patient Health Questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36, Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function, and Duke Social Support Index. Logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree analysis were performed. Of 378 hospitalized patients approached, 294 (31% females) enrolled in the study and 175 participated in CR. The presence of electronic referral, surgical diagnosis, non/former smoker, and strength of physician recommendation (all Ps < .02) were independent predictors for CR participation. No differences were seen in participation by measures of anxiety, depression, or executive function. Males with a profile of electronic referral to CR, high school or higher education, ejection fraction >50%, and strong physician recommendation were the most likely cohort to participate in CR (89%). Patients not referred to CR were the least likely to attend (20%).

The literature search focused on studies that evaluated the implementation and efficacy of using digital technologies within CR. Digital technology offers significant opportunities to improve CR by providing flexible and scalable solutions that can overcome traditional barriers to CR such as accessibility and capacity constraints. Remote or virtual CR delivery that incorporates digital technologies improves CR adherence and achieves similar improvements in exercise capacity when compared to in-person CR. While the majority of studies have focused on exercise, digital technologies are increasingly used to deliver comprehensive CR solutions as part of remote and virtual CR programs. However, challenges and gaps in the literature remain, such as the impact of digital literacy and promoting equitable CR access, particularly in high-risk and vulnerable populations.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate sex differences for changes in CRF and cardiometabolic health indicators after HIIT in adults with coronary artery disease (CAD). A systemic search of five electronic databases for studies examining the effect of HIIT on measured CRF and cardiometabolic health indicators in adults with CAD was performed. Data (published and unpublished) from 14 studies were included in the meta-analyses with approximately eightfold greater male than female participation (n = 836 vs n = 103). Males with CAD achieved a near-significant absolute improvement in CRF (mean difference [MD] = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.08 to 2.23 mL·kg-1⋅min-1, P = 0.07) after HIIT when compared with control; there were insufficient data to conduct such an analysis in females. Significantly smaller improvements in CRF were experienced by females than males (MD = -1.10, 95% CI = -2.08 to -0.12 mL·kg-1⋅min-1, P = 0.03); there was no sex difference for the relative (percentage) change in CRF after HIIT.

Sixty-six patients with INOCA underwent stress cardiac magnetic resonance with calculation of myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR); MPR 2.0 to 2.4 was considered borderline-reduced (possible CMD) and MPR <2.0 was defined as reduced (definite CMD). Subjects completed quality of life questionnaires to assess the morbidity and economic impact of INOCA. Questionnaire results were compared between INOCA patients with and without CMD. In addition, logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of CMD within the INOCA population. The prevalence of definite CMD was 24%. Definite or borderline CMD was present in 59% (MPR ≤2.4). Patients with INOCA reported greater physical limitation, angina frequency, and reduced quality of life compared to referent stable coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction populations. In addition, Patients with INOCA reported frequent time missed from work and work limitations, suggesting a substantial economic impact. No difference was observed in reported symptoms between INOCA patients with and without CMD. Glomerular filtration rate and body-mass index were significant predictors of CMD in multivariable regression analysis. INOCA is associated with high morbidity similar to other high-risk cardiac populations, and work limitations reported by Patients with INOCA suggest a substantial economic impact. CMD is a common cause of INOCA but is not associated with increased morbidity. These results suggest that there is significant symptom burden in the INOCA population regardless of etiology.",success

In this prospective, multicenter, international, observational study, we enrolled women with a clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction. If invasive coronary angiography revealed <50% stenosis in all major arteries, multivessel OCT was performed, followed by CMR (cine imaging, late gadolinium enhancement, and T2-weighted imaging and T1 mapping). Angiography, OCT, and CMR were evaluated at blinded, independent core laboratories. Culprit lesions identified by OCT were classified as definite or possible. The CMR core laboratory identified ischemia-related and nonischemic myocardial injury. Imaging results were combined to determine the mechanism of MINOCA, when possible. Among 301 women enrolled at 16 sites, 170 were diagnosed with MINOCA, of whom 145 had adequate OCT image quality for analysis; 116 of these underwent CMR. A definite or possible culprit lesion was identified by OCT in 46.2% (67/145) of participants, most commonly plaque rupture, intraplaque cavity, or layered plaque.

This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure. At discharge, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively.

Cardiotoxicity outcomes reported by ≥3 studies were pooled and structured around the type of exercise intervention. Forty articles were included, of which 3 were clinical studies. Overall, in humans (sample sizes ranging from 24 to 61), results were indicative of exercise-mediated cardioprotection, yet they were not sufficient to establish whether physical exercise protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. In animal studies (n=37), a pooled analysis demonstrated that forced exercise interventions significantly mitigated in vivo and ex vivo doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity compared with nonexercised controls. Similar yet slightly smaller effects were found for voluntary exercise interventions. We identified oxidative stress and related pathways, and less doxorubicin accumulation as mechanisms underlying exercise-induced cardioprotection, of which the latter could act as an overarching mechanism.

The main purpose of this study was to examine disparities in CR referral and participation rates among individuals from rural communities and racial and ethnic minority groups with coronary heart disease (CHD) when compared to the general population. A systematic search of standard databases including MedlLine, PubMed, and Cochrane databases was conducted using keywords that included cardiac rehabilitation, women, race and ethnicity, disparities, and rural populations. Twenty-eight clinical studies from 1990 to 2017 were selected and included 478,955 patients with CHD. The majority of available clinical studies showed significantly lower CR referral and participation rates among individuals from rural communities, women, and racial and ethnic groups when compared to the general population. Similar to geographic region, socioeconomic status (SES) appears to directly impact the use of CR programs. Patients of lower SES have significantly lower CR referral and participation rates than patients of higher SES. Data presented underscores the need for systematic referrals using electronic health records for patients with CHD in order to increase overall CR referral and participation rates of minority populations and other vulnerable groups. Educational programs that target healthcare provider biases towards racial and ethnic groups may help attenuate observed disparities. Alternative modalities such as home-based and internet-based CR programs may also help improve CR participation rates among vulnerable populations.",success

Second, to assess intervention costs and associated harms, as well as interventions intended to promote equitable CR utilisation in vulnerable patient subpopulations. Review authors performed a search on 10 July 2018, to identify studies published since publication of the previous systematic review. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) databases (Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)), in the Cochrane Library (Wiley); MEDLINE (Ovid); Embase (Elsevier); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost); and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) on Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics). We checked the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews for additional studies and also searched two clinical trial registers. We applied no language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with myocardial infarction, with angina, undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, or with heart failure who were eligible for cardiac rehabilitation. Interventions had to aim to increase utilisation of comprehensive phase II cardiac rehabilitation. We included only studies that measured one or more of our primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were harms and costs, and we focused on equity. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified references for eligibility, and we obtained full papers of potentially relevant trials. Two review authors independently considered these trials for inclusion, assessed included studies for risk of bias, and extracted trial data independently. We resolved disagreements through consultation with a third review author. We performed random-effects meta-regression for each outcome and explored prespecified study characteristics. Overall, we included 26 studies with 5299 participants (29 comparisons). Participants were primarily male (64.2%). Ten (38.5%) studies included patients with heart failure. We assessed most studies as having low or unclear risk of bias. Sixteen studies (3164 participants) reported interventions to improve enrolment in cardiac rehabilitation, 11 studies (2319 participants) reported interventions to improve adherence to cardiac rehabilitation, and seven studies (1567 participants) reported interventions to increase programme completion. Researchers tested a variety of interventions to increase utilisation of cardiac rehabilitation. In many studies, this consisted of contacts made by a healthcare provider during or shortly after an acute care hospitalisation.Low-quality evidence shows an effect of interventions on increasing programme enrolment (19 comparisons; risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.42). Meta-regression revealed that the intervention deliverer (nurse or allied healthcare provider; P = 0.02) and the delivery format (face-to-face; P = 0.01) were influential in increasing enrolment. Low-quality evidence shows interventions to increase adherence were effective (nine comparisons; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55), particularly when they were delivered remotely, such as in home-based programs (SMD 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.76). Moderate-quality evidence shows interventions to increase programme completion were also effective (eight comparisons; RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25), but those applied in multi-centre studies were less effective than those given in single-centre studies, leading to questions regarding generalisability. A moderate level of statistical heterogeneity across intervention studies reflects heterogeneity in intervention approaches. There was no evidence of small-study bias for enrolment (insufficient studies to test for this in the other outcomes).With regard to secondary outcomes, no studies reported on harms associated with the interventions. Only two studies reported costs. In terms of equity, trialists tested interventions designed to improve utilisation among women and older patients. Evidence is insufficient for quantitative assessment of whether women-tailored programmes were associated with increased utilisation, and studies that assess motivating women are needed. For older participants, again while quantitative assessment could not be undertaken, peer navigation may improve enrolment. Interventions may increase cardiac rehabilitation enrolment, adherence and completion; however the quality of evidence was low to moderate due to heterogeneity of the interventions used, among other factors. Effects on enrolment were larger in studies targeting healthcare providers, training nurses, or allied healthcare providers to intervene face-to-face; effects on adherence were larger in studies that tested remote interventions.

We included 33 trials (118 863 patients) evaluating intermittent auscultation with Pinard stethoscope/handheld Doppler (IA), cardiotocography (CTG), computerized cardiotocography (cCTG), CTG with fetal scalp lactate (CTG-lactate), CTG with fetal scalp pH analysis (CTG-FBS), CTG with fetal pulse oximetry (FPO-CTG), CTG with fetal heart electrocardiogram (CTG-STAN) and their combinations. Intermittent auscultation reduced the risk of emergency cesarean deliveries compared with other types of surveillance (IA v. CTG: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.97; IA v. CTG-FBS: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.80; IA v.CTG-lactate: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.92; IA v. FPO-CTG: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.87; IA v.FPO-CTG-FBS: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.99; cCTG-FBS v. IA: RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04-1.42), except STAN-CTG-FBS (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.98-1.40). There was a similar reduction observed for emergency cesarean deliveries for fetal distress. None of the evaluated methods was associated with a reduced risk of neonatal acidemia, neonatal unit admissions, Apgar scores or perinatal death. Compared with other types of fetal surveillance, intermittent auscultation seems to reduce emergency cesarean deliveries in labour without increasing adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes.",success
34011892,False,Journal Article;Practice Guideline,,,,,,,,True,"The purpose of this Committee Opinion is to offer guidance about indications for and timing and frequency of antenatal fetal surveillance in the outpatient setting. Antenatal fetal surveillance is performed to reduce the risk of stillbirth. However, because the pathway that results in increased risk of stillbirth for a given condition may not be known and antenatal fetal surveillance has not been shown to improve perinatal outcomes for all conditions associated with stillbirth, it is challenging to create a prescriptive list of all indications for which antenatal fetal surveillance should be considered. This Committee Opinion provides guidance on and suggests surveillance for conditions for which stillbirth is reported to occur more frequently than 0.8 per 1,000 (the false-negative rate of a biophysical profile) and which are associated with a relative risk or odds ratio for stillbirth of more than 2.0 compared with pregnancies without the condition. Table 1 presents suggestions for the timing and frequency of testing for specific conditions. As with all testing and interventions, shared decision making between the pregnant individual and the clinician is critically important when considering or offering antenatal fetal surveillance for individuals with pregnancies at high risk for stillbirth or with multiple comorbidities that increase the risk of stillbirth. It is important to emphasize that the guidance offered in this Committee Opinion should be construed only as suggestions; this guidance should not be construed as mandates or as all encompassing.

Only observational studies of term infants reporting outcomes of interest with category I, II, or III fetal heart rate tracings were included. The coprimary outcome was the rate of either Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes or umbilical artery pH <7.00. Secondary outcomes were divided into neonatal and maternal adverse outcomes. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random-effect meta-analyses of proportions were used to estimate the pooled rates of each categorical outcome in fetal heart rate tracing category I, II, and III patterns, and random-effect head-to-head meta-analyses were used to directly compare fetal heart rate tracings category I vs II and fetal heart rate tracing category II vs III, expressing the results as summary odds ratio or as mean differences with relative 95% confidence intervals. Of the 671 articles reviewed, 3 publications met the inclusion criteria. Among them were 47,648 singletons at ≥37 weeks' gestation.

Each FHR pattern has been color-coded, from no threat of fetal acidemia (green, no intervention required) to severe threat of acidemia (red, rapid delivery recommended). Three intermediate categories (blue, yellow, and orange) require escalated informing of appropriate individuals for intervention and resuscitation (obstetrician, anesthesiologist, and neonatal resuscitator) and preparation for urgent delivery (eg, staff and surgical suite availability and conservative techniques to ameliorate the FHR patterns).

This study aimed to describe which electronic fetal monitoring features are most commonly associated with first-stage cesarean delivery for nonreassuring fetal status, and to evaluate the risk of neonatal acidemia following cesarean delivery for nonreassuring fetal status. This was a nested case-control study in a prospectively collected cohort of patients with singleton pregnancies at ≥37 weeks' gestation, admitted in spontaneous labor or for induction of labor from 2010 to 2014 at a single tertiary care center. Patients with preterm pregnancies, multiple gestations, planned cesarean delivery, or nonreassuring fetal status in the second stage of labor were excluded. Cases were identified as having nonreassuring fetal status on the basis of what was documented in the operative note by the delivering physician. Controls were patients without nonreassuring fetal status within 1 hour of delivery. Cases were matched to controls in a 1:2 ratio by parity, obesity, and history of cesarean delivery. Electronic fetal monitoring data were abstracted by credentialed obstetrical research nurses for the 60 minutes before delivery. The primary exposure of interest was the incidence of high-risk category II electronic fetal monitoring features in the 60 minutes before delivery; in particular, the incidence of minimal variability, recurrent late decelerations, recurrent variable decelerations, tachycardia, and >1 prolonged deceleration were compared between groups. We also compared neonatal outcomes between cases and controls, including fetal acidemia (umbilical artery pH <7.1), other umbilical artery gas analytes, and neonatal and maternal outcomes. Of the 8580 patients in the parent study, 714 (8.3%) underwent cesarean delivery for nonreassuring fetal status in the first stage of labor. Patients diagnosed with nonreassuring fetal status requiring cesarean delivery were more likely to have recurrent late decelerations, >1 prolonged deceleration, and recurrent variable decelerations compared with controls. More than 1 prolonged deceleration was associated with 6 times increased rate of nonreassuring fetal status diagnosis resulting in cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 6.73 [95% confidence interval, 2.47-8.33]). Rates of fetal tachycardia were similar between groups. Minimal variability was less common in the nonreassuring fetal status group compared with controls (adjusted odds ratio, 0.36 [95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.54]).

The potential performance of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring under ideal circumstances was evaluated in an outcomes-blinded examination fetal heart rate tracing of infants with metabolic acidemia at birth (base deficit, >12) and matched control infants (base deficit, <8) under the following conditions: (1) expert primary interpretation, (2) use of a published algorithm that was developed and endorsed by a large group of national experts, (3) assumption of a 30-minute period of evaluation for noncritical category II fetal heart rate tracings, followed by delivery within 30 minutes, (4) evaluation without the need to provide patient care simultaneously, and (5) comparison of results under these circumstances with those achieved in actual clinical practice. During the study period, 120 infants were identified with an arterial cord blood base deficit of >12 mM/L. Matched control infants were not demographically different from subjects. In actual practice, operative intervention on the basis of an abnormal fetal heart rate tracings occurred in 36 of 120 fetuses (30.0%) with metabolic acidemia. Based on expert, algorithm-assisted reviews, 55 of 120 patients with acidemia (45.8%) were judged to need operative intervention for abnormal fetal heart rate tracings. This difference was significant (P=.016). In infants who were born with a base deficit of >12 mM/L in which blinded, algorithm-assisted expert review indicated the need for operative delivery, the decision for delivery would have been made an average of 131 minutes before the actual delivery. The rate of expert intervention for fetal heart rate concerns in the nonacidemic control group (22/120; 18.3%) was similar to the actual intervention rate (23/120; 19.2%; P=1.0) Expert review did not mandate earlier delivery in 65 of 120 patients with metabolic acidemia. The primary features of these 65 cases included the occurrence of sentinel events with prolonged deceleration just before delivery, the rapid deterioration of nonemergent category II fetal heart rate tracings before realistic time frames for recognition and intervention, and the failure of recognized fetal heart rate patterns such as variability to identify metabolic acidemia. Expert, algorithm-assisted fetal heart rate interpretation has the potential to improve standard clinical performance by facilitating significantly earlier recognition of some tracings that are associated with metabolic acidemia without increasing the rate of operative intervention. However, this improvement is modest. Of infants who are born with metabolic acidemia, only approximately one-half potentially could be identified and have delivery expedited even under ideal circumstances, which are probably not realistic in current US practice. This represents the limits of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring performance. Additional technologies will be necessary if the goal of the prevention of neonatal metabolic acidemia is to be realized.",success

Patients indicated for surgery received an operation within 1 week. The MDCT findings were compared with the operative findings. One patient with a Björk-Shiley valve could not be evaluated by MDCT due to a severe beam-hardening artifact; thus, the exclusion rate for MDCT was 3.2% (1/31). Prosthetic valve disorders were suspected in 12 patients by either MDCT or TTE. Six patients received an operation that included three redo aortic valve replacements, two redo mitral replacements and one Amplatzer ductal occluder occlusion of a mitral paravalvular leak.

Fifty-four patients (27 men; mean age, 75 years + or - 8 [standard deviation]) with bioprosthetic AVR implanted 2 years + or - 3 earlier underwent 64-section CT and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Two blinded observers manually planimetered the aortic valve area (AVA) by using a computer workstation on end-systolic short-axis CT images and measured opening angles (OAs) between the bioprosthesis annulus base and the free margin on long-axis images. These measurements were compared with those of the effective orifice area (EOA) of the valve at Doppler continuity-equation TTE by using regression and Bland-Altman methods. Morphology and mobility of leaflets in normally functioning (EOA indexed to body surface area [EOA(i)] > 0.65 cm(2)/m(2)) and dysfunctional (EOA(i)< 0.65 cm(2)/m(2)) AVRs were compared. AVA at CT correlated highly to EOA at TTE (r = 0.93, P < .001) but was significantly larger (1.2 cm(2) + or - 0.4 vs 1.1 cm(2) + or - 0.3, P < .001) than EOA at TTE. In dysfunctional bioprostheses (n = 34), CT results showed a variety of morphologic abnormalities, such as leaflet thickening (n = 9), presumed thrombotic material (n = 6), and leaflet calcification (n = 1). Multidetector CT results demonstrated restriction of leaflet motion indicated by lower OA (64 degrees + or - 5 vs 79 degrees + or - 3, P < .0001) in dysfunctional AVRs than in normally functioning AVRs (n = 11).

In this paper, we propose an automated approach for bileaflet MHV leaflet angle computation. This method consists of four steps. After a one click selection of the MHV region on an axial image, an automatic MHV extraction using thresholding, and a connected component analysis based on voxel intensities is performed. Then, the MHV component (valve ring and two leaflets) positions are identified using random sample consensus and least square fitting. Finally, the angles are automatically computed based on the orientation of the components in each timeframe. Five multiphase CT scans from patients with a bileaflet MHV containing between 14 and 17 timepoints were used for development and another 15 were used for evaluation. The detected MHV components were scored for their overlap with real components as successful or unsuccessful. For successful results, the angles were compared to those measured by a radiologist. Qualitatively evaluated on a data set of 222 images, a total of 398 out of 444 angle computations (89.6%) were rated as successful.

We determined the reliability and agreement of PHV size measurements using multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) and provide reference values of MDCT measurements compared with manufacturer specifications. In vitro, 15 different PHV types in available sizes (total n = 63) were imaged. In vivo, available MDCT acquisitions of patients with PHVs were retrospectively gathered in 2 centers, and 230 patients with 249 PHVs were included. Inner valve area and area-derived diameter were measured in all PHVs. For mechanical PHVs, the inner diameter was also measured. Data were analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots and related to manufacturer specifications. Measurements could be obtained for all PHV types, except the Björk-Shiley (n = 7) because of severe valve-related artifacts hampering the image quality. Intrarater and interrater reliability was excellent for biological and mechanical PHVs (intraclass correlation coefficients ≥0.903). Agreement was good for all measurements with an overall maximal mean difference (95% confidence interval) of -2.61 mm(2) (-37.9 to 32.7), -0.1 mm (-1.1 to 1.0), and 0 mm (-0.4 to 0.3) for valve area, area-derived diameter, and inner diameter, respectively. MDCT reliably discriminated consecutive PHV sizes as labeled by the manufacturer because the absolute ranges for the measurements never overlapped. In conclusion, MDCT allows assessment of the implanted PHV size with excellent reliability and agreement and can discriminate between PHV sizes for contemporary prostheses.

Twenty sequential patients with 23 mechanical prosthetic valves were evaluated with an ECG-gated 40- or 64-MDCT scanner. Multiplanar reformation, maximal-intensity-projection, volume-rendering, and volume-averaging techniques were used for visualization of valve leaflets in systole and diastole. The visibility of each mechanical valve was evaluated by consensus of a radiologist and a cardiologist using a subjective 5-point scale (0-4). MDCT findings were correlated with fluoroscopic opening and closing angle measurements and echocardiographic pressure gradient measurements in 11 and 19 valves, respectively. The series included 18 bileaflet and five single-leaflet mechanical valves. The visibility score for the bileaflet mechanical valves was excellent (score of 4) in all 18 cases, but it was lower for single-leaflet valves (mean score, 2.8; range, 1-4) (p = 0.04). Bland-Altman plots showed high agreement between MDCT and fluoroscopy for measurements of opening and closing angles of bileaflet mechanical valves. In four patients, a stuck valve was seen on MDCT and was confirmed by fluoroscopy. Doppler echocardiography showed increased transvalvular pressure in two of the four patients with a stuck mitral valve and increased transaortic pressure in four patients with normal prosthetic aortic valve motion.

In case of mass detection by TEE, predictors for obstructive thrombus masses (compared with pannus masses) were leaflet restriction, soft echo density, and increased mass length. In situations of inconclusive echocardiography, MDCT may correctly detect pannus/thrombus based on the morphological aspects and localization. In acquired mechanical PHV obstruction without leaflet restriction and absent mass on TEE, obstructive PHV thrombosis cannot be confirmed and consequently, fibrinolysis is not advised.

The presence of APR was evaluated with 64-row MDCT, and validated with 2D-TTE, two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (2D-TEE), or intraoperative findings if available. If APR was present, we also evaluated paraprosthetic anatomical regurgitation orifice (PARO) area to quantify the prognostic impact of APR or for surgical planning such as closure device sizing. Overall, 12 of 20 valves showed beam-hardening artifact (BHA) which made the reliable evaluation of APR difficult. The presence of artifact seemed to depend on valve types. Among 8 patients who did not show BHA, there were perfect agreements between MDCT and 2D-TTE, 2D-TEE, or intra-operative findings about APR. There were excellent inter-observer agreements in the evaluation of APR and PARO area. PARO area was consistent with the echocardiographic severity of APR in this study. Our retrospective data suggest that MDCT could be a reliable technique for the evaluation of APR after On-X standard or SJM standard valve replacement. MDCT can become a novel quantitative tool for the evaluation of PARO area.",success

Clinical scenarios in IE are often complex, requiring prompt diagnosis, early institution of antibiotics, and decision-making related to complications, including risk of embolism and timing of surgery when indicated. The importance of an early, multispecialty team approach to patients with IE is emphasized. Management issues are divided into groups of questions related to indications for and timing of surgery, pre-surgical work-up, preoperative antibiotic treatment, surgical risk assessment, intraoperative management, surgical management, surveillance, and follow up. Standard indications for surgery are severe heart failure, severe valve dysfunction, prosthetic valve infection, invasion beyond the valve leaflets, recurrent systemic embolization, large mobile vegetations, or persistent sepsis despite adequate antibiotic therapy for more than 5-7 days. The guidelines emphasize that once an indication for surgery is established, the operation should be performed as soon as possible. Timing of surgery in patients with strokes and neurologic deficits require close collaboration with neurological services. In surgery infected and necrotic tissue and foreign material is radically debrided and removed. Valve repair is performed whenever possible, particularly for the mitral and tricuspid valves. When simple valve replacement is required, choice of valve-mechanical or tissue prosthesis-should be based on normal criteria for valve replacement. For patients with invasive disease and destruction, reconstruction should depend on the involved valve, severity of destruction, and available options for cardiac reconstruction.

Studies with sufficient data were included in a meta-analysis comparing the risk of stroke between patients with SCVT and those with normal valve function, as well as the protective effects of antiplatelet and anticoagulation on preventing SCVT. From 3456 patients examined in a comprehensive review, 398 patients (11.5%) demonstrated evidence of SCVT during follow-up. Dual antiplatelet therapy was given in 45.5% of cases, single antiplatelet therapy in 19.8%, and oral anticoagulation in 28.5%. A meta-analysis demonstrated that rates of stroke were more than 3 times greater in patients with SCVT compared with those without (logistic odds, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.57, P < .0001). Oral anticoagulation was superior to dual antiplatelet therapy or single antiplatelet therapy, preventing the formation of SCVT (logistic odds, -1.05, 95% confidence interval, -1.71 to -0.39, P < .0001). Subclinical valve thrombosis is seen in 11.5% of patients after TAVI and is associated with increased risk of stroke. When oral anticoagulation is used postprocedurally, it is more effective than either dual or single-antiplatelet therapy in preventing subclinical valve thrombosis. These findings suggest that further studies are needed to define the optimal antithrombotic regimen to mitigate thrombotic and embolic sequelae after TAVI.",success

Although favorable short- and medium-term outcomes have been reported, thrombosis of the transcatheter heart valve (THV) has occurred, with two different entities being described: clinical valve thrombosis and subclinical leaflet thrombosis. In clinical valve thrombosis, an increase in transvalvular gradient appears as a result of obstructive thrombus formation, which eventually leads to symptoms of heart failure. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis is an incidental finding, characterized by a thin layer of thrombus covering the aortic site of the leaflet-called hypo-attenuating leaflet thickening (HALT)-as described on and defined by 4-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) imaging. This phenomenon may affect motion of the leaflets and is then classified as hypo-attenuation affecting motion (HAM).

These benefits derive from the distinct features of PCDs, which are made of semiconductor materials capable of converting photons directly into electric signal. PCCT advancements include, among the most important, improved spatial resolution, noise reduction, and spectral properties. PCCT spatial resolution on the order of 0.25 mm allows for the improved visualization of small structures (eg, small vessels, arterial walls, distal bronchi, and bone trabeculations) and their pathologies, as well as the identification of previously undetectable anomalies. In addition, blooming artifacts from calcifications, stents, and other dense structures are reduced. The benefits of the spectral capabilities of PCCT are broad and include reducing radiation and contrast material dose for patients. In addition, multiple types of information can be extracted from a single data set (ie, multiparametric imaging), including quantitative data often regarded as surrogates of functional information (eg, lung perfusion).

Results were validated using in vivo 4D Flow MRI. The computed flow fields were compared to calculations following virtual implantation of a mechanical heart valve oriented in four different angles to assess the effect of leaflet position. Flow patterns were visualized in long- and short-axes and quantified with flow component analysis. In comparison to a native valve, valve implantation increased the proportion of the mitral inflow remaining in the basal region and further increased the residual volume in the apical area.

Compared with healthy adults, frail adults had a significantly higher risk of mortality from all causes (HR 2.40; 95% CI 2.17-2.65), CVD (HR 2.64; 95% CI 2.20-3.17), respiratory illness (HR 4.91; 95% CI 2.97-8.12), and cancer (HR 1.97; 95% CI 1.50-2.57). Similar results were found for the association between prefrail adults and mortality risk. In addition, based on the studies that have reported the HRs of the mortality risk per 0.1 and per 0.01 increase in the frailty index, we obtained consistent results. The present study demonstrated that frailty was not only significantly related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality but was also a strong predictor of cause-specific mortality from CVD, cancer, and respiratory illness in community-dwelling adults.

Definitions of frailty have included a variety of domains, including physical performance, sarcopenia, disability, comorbidity, and cognitive and psychological impairments, many of which are common in advanced HF. Multiple groups have recently recommended incorporating frailty assessments into clinical practice and research studies, indicating the need to standardize the definition and measurement of frailty in advanced HF. Therefore, the purpose of this consensus statement is to provide an integrated perspective on the definition of frailty in advanced HF and to generate a consensus on how to assess and manage frailty. We convened a group of HF clinicians and researchers who have expertise in frailty and related geriatric conditions in HF, and we focused on the patient with advanced HF. Herein, we provide an overview of frailty and how it has been applied in advanced HF (including potential mechanisms), present a definition of frailty, generate suggested assessments of frailty, provide guidance to differentiate frailty and related terms, and describe the assessment and management in advanced HF, including with surgical and nonsurgical interventions.

Transthyretin (TTR) protein transports thyroxine (thyroid hormone) and retinol (vitamin A) and is synthesized predominantly by the liver. When the TTR protein misfolds, it can form amyloid fibrils that deposit in the heart causing heart failure, heart conduction block, or arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation. The biological processes by which amyloid fibrils form are incompletely understood but are associated with aging and, in some patients, affected by inherited variants in the TTR genetic sequence. ATTR amyloidosis results from misfolded TTR protein deposition. ATTR can occur in association with normal TTR genetic sequence (wild-type ATTR) or with abnormal TTR genetic sequence (variant ATTR). Wild-type ATTR primarily manifests as cardiomyopathy while ATTR due to a genetic variant manifests as cardiomyopathy and/or polyneuropathy. Approximately 50 000 to 150 000 people in the US have heart failure due to ATTR amyloidosis. Without treatment, heart failure due to ATTR amyloidosis is associated with a median survival of approximately 5 years. More than 130 different inherited genetic variants in TTR exist. The most common genetic variant is Val122Ile (pV142I), an allele with an origin in West African countries, that is present in 3.4% of African American individuals in the US or approximately 1.5 million persons. The diagnosis can be made using serum free light chain assay and immunofixation electrophoresis to exclude light chain amyloidosis combined with cardiac nuclear scintigraphy to detect radiotracer uptake in a pattern consistent with amyloidosis. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide, are the primary treatment for fluid overload and symptomatic relief of patients with ATTR heart failure. An ATTR-directed therapy that inhibited misfolding of the TTR protein (tafamidis, a protein stabilizer), compared with placebo, reduced mortality from 42.9% to 29.5%, reduced hospitalizations from 0.7/year to 0.48/year, and was most effective when administered early in disease course. ATTR amyloidosis causes cardiomyopathy in up to approximately 150 000 people in the US and tafamidis is the only currently approved therapy. Tafamidis slowed progression of ATTR amyloidosis and improved survival and prevented hospitalization, compared with placebo, in people with ATTR-associated cardiomyopathy.",success

Both upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms were significant negative predictors of mBMI and the EQ-5D Index Score (p < 0.001 for all). Gastrointestinal symptoms were common in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and had a significant negative impact on their nutritional status and HRQoL.

In total, 28 patients with suspected systemic amyloidosis were included. Among these, 21 presented with cardiomyopathy but lacked myopathic symptoms. The clinical and pathological data of these patients were further analysed. The amyloid type was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Twenty-eight patients with suspected systemic amyloidosis underwent muscle biopsy. Amyloid deposition in the skeletal muscle was confirmed in 24 patients, including 22 with light-chain amyloidosis (AL) and two with transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). Among the 24 patients, seven presented with muscle weakness and decreased muscle strength (Group 1, symptomatic myopathy), whereas the remaining 17 exhibited normal muscle strength (Group 2, asymptomatic myopathy). Group 1 included four patients with AL-λ, one with AL-κ and two with ATTR. Group 2 included 15 patients with AL-λ and two patients with AL-κ. In Group 1, six patients exhibited neuropathy, whereas only one patient in Group 2 presented with subclinical neuropathy on nerve conduction studies. Amyloid deposition in the interstitium was the most obvious change, observed in all 24 patients. Neuropathic changes, including denervation atrophy and muscle fibre grouping, were also common. Except for type 2 fibre atrophy, the other myopathic changes were mild and nonspecific. No sarcolemmal disruption was observed. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed marked positivity for MAC and MHC1 expression in the regions with amyloid deposits. Clinicopathological analysis revealed no significant differences in the extent of muscular amyloid deposition between the two groups. Nevertheless, patients in Group 1 displayed more pronounced neurogenic atrophy on skeletal muscle biopsies.

The ""frailty index"" is based on the accumulation of deficits (symptoms, signs, disease classifications) as analyzed in the National Population Health Survey, a representative Canadian population sample (n = 81,859). The accumulation of deficits has both an age-independent (background) component and an age-dependent (exponential) component, akin to the well-known Gompertz-Makeham model for the risk of mortality. While women accumulate more deficits than men of the same age, on average, their rate of accumulation is lower, so the difference in the level of deficits between men and women decreases with age. Two possible invariants of the process of accumulation of deficits were found: (1) the age at which the average proportion of deficits coincides for men and women is 94 years, which closely matches the species-specific lifespan in humans (95 +/- 2); (2) the value of the frailty index (proportion of deficits), which corresponds to that age (0.18). The similarity between mortality kinetics and the accumulation of deficits (frailty kinetics), and the coincidence of the time parameters in the frailty and mortality models make it possible to express mortality risk in terms of accumulated deficits.

They are small (104 amino acids) and have a striking relationship to the acute phase response with serum levels rising as much as 1000-fold in 24 hours. SAA proteins are encoded in a family of closely-related genes and have been remarkably conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. Amino-terminal fragments of SAA can form highly organized, insoluble fibrils that accumulate in ""secondary"" amyloid disease. Despite their evolutionary preservation and dynamic synthesis pattern SAA proteins have lacked well-defined physiologic roles. However, considering an array of many, often unrelated, reports now permits a more coordinated perspective. Protein studies have elucidated basic SAA structure and fibril formation. Appreciating SAA's lipophilicity helps relate it to lipid transport and metabolism as well as atherosclerosis. SAA's function as a cytokine-like protein has become recognized in cell-cell communication as well as feedback in inflammatory, immunologic, neoplastic and protective pathways. SAA likely has a critical role in control and possibly propagation of the primordial acute phase response.

Serum AA protein (SAA), an acute phase plasma protein, is deposited extracellularly as insoluble amyloid fibrils that damage tissue structure and function. Clinical AA amyloidosis is typically preceded by many years of active inflammation before presenting, most commonly with renal involvement. Using dose-dependent, doxycycline-inducible transgenic expression of SAA in mice, we show that AA amyloid deposition can occur independently of inflammation and that the time before amyloid deposition is determined by the circulating SAA concentration. High level SAA expression induced amyloidosis in all mice after a short, slightly variable delay. SAA was rapidly incorporated into amyloid, acutely reducing circulating SAA concentrations by up to 90%. Prolonged modest SAA overexpression occasionally produced amyloidosis after long delays and primed most mice for explosive amyloidosis when SAA production subsequently increased. Endogenous priming and bulk amyloid deposition are thus separable events, each sensitive to plasma SAA concentration. Amyloid deposits slowly regressed with restoration of normal SAA production after doxycycline withdrawal. Reinduction of SAA overproduction revealed that, following amyloid regression, all mice were primed, especially for rapid glomerular amyloid deposition leading to renal failure, closely resembling the rapid onset of renal failure in clinical AA amyloidosis following acute exacerbation of inflammation. Clinical AA amyloidosis rarely involves the heart, but amyloidotic SAA transgenic mice consistently had minor cardiac amyloid deposits, enabling us to extend to the heart the demonstrable efficacy of our unique antibody therapy for elimination of visceral amyloid.",success

The benefits of regular physical activity or exercise with regard to aging and disease are indisputable, yet many clinicians do not prescribe exercise to older adults. This reluctance may be attributable to a lack of knowledge regarding appropriate exercise prescription for older adults in light of the potential risks and benefits of various doses and types of exercise. In addition, clinicians and patients may have concerns about potential health considerations relevant to older adults such as comprehensive pre-exercise screening and exercise-drug interactions. In light of this, the following review presents (1) guidelines for exercise prescription in older adults and modification of these guidelines for patients with the most common age-associated comorbidities; (2) recommendations for pre-exercise screening prior to initiating an exercise program in older adults; (3) considerations for older adults on one or more medications; and (4) common barriers to adopting and maintaining exercise in an older population.

Patients with dementia and frailty often develop malnutrition and weight loss. Rigorous nutritional, pharmacological, and non-pharmacological interventions generally are required for these patients, which is a challenging issue for healthcare providers. A healthy diet and lifestyle instigated at an early age can reduce the risk of frailty and dementia.

Endpoints included changes in weight, loop diuretic dose, and cardiac/renal biomarkers. The median age of the overall population was 79 (interquartile range [IQR] 11) years. Nearly 90% of patients were male, and 93% were on a transthyretin stabilizer. Control patients demonstrated generally less severe disease at baseline compared to SGLT2i-treated patients, with lower median Columbia risk score (p < 0.001). Median follow-up time was 5.6 (IQR 5.2) and 8.4 (IQR 2.1) months in the SGLT2i and control cohorts, respectively. Compared with controls, SGLT2i treatment was associated with significantly greater reductions from baseline in weight, loop diuretic dose, and uric acid during follow-up (p < 0.001). While no significant between-group differences were observed on cardiac biomarkers, estimated glomerular filtration rate was significantly reduced versus controls 1 month after SGLT2i initiation (p = 0.002), but no significant differences were observed at later timepoints. Results were similar in a propensity score-matched analysis (n = 42 per cohort). A total of 10 (11.5%) patients discontinued SGLT2i, most commonly due to genitourinary symptoms. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were well tolerated by most patients with ATTR-CM and appeared to improve volume status and combat diuretic resistance.

We tested the association of neurohormonal blockade use with survival. Methods and Results A total of 309 consecutive patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis were identified. Medication inventory was obtained at baseline and subsequent visits. Exposure included a neurohormonal blockade class (β-blocker [βB], angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and mineralocorticoid antagonist) at baseline and subsequent visits. βB was modeled as baseline use, time-varying use, and in an inverse probability treatment weighted model. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality analyzed with adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Continuing compared with stopping βB during follow-up was tested. Mean age was 73.2 years, 84.1% were men, and 17.2% had atrial fibrillation/flutter at baseline. At the time of study entry, 49.8% were on βBs, 35.0% were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 23.9% were on mineralocorticoid antagonists. For the total cohort, there was a trend toward harm in the unadjusted model for baseline βB use, but this was neutral after adjustment. When βB use was analyzed as a time-varying exposure, there was no association with mortality. βB discontinuation was associated with decreased mortality for the total cohort. Findings were consistent in inverse probability treatment weighted models. For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker or mineralocorticoid antagonist use, there was no association with mortality after adjustment for the total cohort. Conclusions There was no association of neurohormonal blockade use with survival in transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. For the total cohort, deprescribing βB may be associated with improved survival. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.",success

After comparing the groups according to the treatment, 14 variables were significantly different-age and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were included in the model. A propensity score reflecting the likelihood of being treated with SGLT2i for each patient was determined using 16 variables. The study comprised 220 patients treated with SGLT2i (age 77 ± 2 years; 82.3% wild-type ATTR-CM; left ventricular ejection fraction 45.8% ± 11%) and 220 propensity-matched control individuals. Adequacy of matching was verified (standardized differences: <0.10 between groups). Discontinuation rate for SGLT2i was 4.5%; at 12 months, SGLT2i treatment was associated with less worsening of NYHA functional class, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and fewer new initiations of loop diuretic agent therapy. Over 28 months (Q1-Q3: 18-45 months), SGLT2i therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.37-0.89; P = 0.010), cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.24-0.71; P < 0.001), heart failure (HF) hospitalization (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.36-0.91; P = 0.014), and the composite outcome of cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalization (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.38-0.84; P = 0.003).

A propensity score-matched analysis demonstrated that treatment with MRAs was independently associated with a reduced risk of mortality in the overall population [hazard ratio (HR) 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.89), P < .001] and in a pre-specified subgroup of patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >40% [HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.63-0.90), P = .002]; and treatment with low-dose beta-blockers was independently associated with a reduced risk of mortality in a pre-specified subgroup of patients with a LVEF ≤40% [HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.45-0.83), P = .002]. No convincing differences were found for treatment with ACEi/ARBs. Conventional heart failure medications are currently not widely prescribed in ATTR-CA, and those that received medication had more severe cardiac disease.

Orthostatic hypotension in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis can be a consequence of heart failure due to amyloid cardiomyopathy or volume depletion due to diarrhea or drug effects. When none of these circumstances are apparent, orthostatic hypotension is usually neurogenic, i.e., caused by impaired norepinephrine release from sympathetic postganglionic neurons, because of neuronal amyloid fibril deposition. When recognized, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can be treated. Discontinuation of potentially aggravating medications, patient education and non-pharmacologic approaches should be applied first. Droxidopa (Northera<sup>®</sup>), a synthetic norepinephrine precursor, has shown efficacy in controlled trials of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in patients with hereditary TTR amyloidosis and is now approved in the US and Asia.

Data used were the age- and sex-specific prevalence of frailty found in SIPAF study (""Système d'Information sur la Perte d'Autonomie Fonctionnelle de la personne âgée"") and statistics of mortality from the Human Mortality Database. The SIPAF study included 2350 individuals aged 70 and over and living in France. Participants were interviewed at home by trained nurses. Frailty was defined as impairment in three domains or more among nutrition, energy, physical activity, strength, and mobility.

A frailty index (FI) for VA (VA-FI) was calculated using the cumulative deficit method. Thirty-one age-related deficits in health from diagnostic and procedure codes were included and were updated biennially. Survival analysis assessed associations between VA-FI and mortality. A VA-FI was calculated for 2,837,152 Veterans over 10 years. In 2002, 35.5% were non-frail (FI = 0-0.10), 32.6% were pre-frail (FI = 0.11-0.20), 18.9% were mildly frail (FI = 0.21-0.30), 8.7% were moderately frail (FI = 0.31-0.40), and 4.3% were severely frail (FI > 0.40). From 2002 to 2012, the prevalence of moderate frailty increased to 12.7%and severe frailty to 14.1%. Frailty was strongly associated with survival and was independent of age, sex, race, and smoking; the VA-FI better predicted mortality than age alone. Although prevalence of frailty rose over time, compared to non-frail Veterans, 2 years' hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for mortality declined from a peak in 2004 of 2.01 (1.97-2.04), 3.49 (3.44-3.55), 5.88 (5.79-5.97), and 10.39 (10.23-10.56) for pre-frail, mildly, moderately, and severely frail, respectively, to 1.51 (1.49-1.53), 2.36 (2.33-2.39), 3.68 (3.63-3.73), 6.62 (6.53-6.71) in 2012.

There was no consensus on a definition of frailty but there was agreement to consider frailty as a pre-disability stage. Being disability a consequence rather than the cause of frailty, frail older people do not necessary need to be disabled. The GAP considered that disability (as a consequence of frailty) should not be included in frailty definitions and assessment tools.

This study used data of three prospective cohorts: China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Frailty status was evaluated by the Rockwood frailty index and classified as robust, pre-frail, or frail. Changes in frailty status were assessed by frailty status at baseline and the second survey which was two years after the baseline. Cardiovascular disease was ascertained by self-reported physician-diagnosed heart disease (including angina, heart attack, congestive heart failure, and other heart problems) or stroke.

This study is focused on the psychosocial aspects of ATTRv from the patient and relative perspectives. In particular, it explored: the practical and psychological burdens experienced by symptomatic patients with ATTRv and their key relatives and the professional and social network support they may rely on; whether burden varied in relation to patients' and relatives' socio-demographic variables, patients' clinical variables, and perceived professional and social network support; and, any difference in burden and support between patients and their matched relatives. The study was carried out on symptomatic patients included in the ATTRv Italian national registry and living with at least one adult relative not suffering from severe illness and being free from ATTRv symptoms. Patients and relatives' assessments were performed using validated self-reported tools. Overall, 141 patients and 69 relatives were evaluated. Constraints of leisure activities, feelings of loss and worries for the future were the consequences of ATTRv most frequently reported by patients and relatives. Both in patients and their relatives, the burden increased with the duration of symptoms and the level of help in daily activities needed by the patient. In the 69 matched patient-relative pairs, the practical burden was significantly higher among the patients than among their relatives, while the psychological burden was similar in the two groups.

All persons with frailty should receive social support as needed to address unmet needs and encourage adherence to a comprehensive care plan (strong recommendation). First-line therapy for the management of frailty should include a multi-component physical activity programme with a resistance-based training component (strong recommendation). Protein/caloric supplementation is recommended when weight loss or undernutrition are present (conditional recommendation). No recommendation was given for systematic additional therapies such as cognitive therapy, problem-solving therapy, vitamin D supplementation, and hormone-based treatment.

Frailty follows from the combination of several impaired physiological mechanisms affecting multiple organs and systems. And, though frailty and sarcopenia are related, they are two different conditions. Thus, strategies to preserve or improve functional status should consider systemic function in addition to muscle conditioning. Physical activity/exercise is considered one of the main strategies to counteract frailty-related physical impairment in the elderly. Exercise reduces age-related oxidative damage and chronic inflammation, increases autophagy, and improves mitochondrial function, myokine profile, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway, and insulin sensitivity. Exercise interventions target resistance (strength and power), aerobic, balance, and flexibility work. Each type improves different aspects of physical functioning, though they could be combined according to need and prescribed as a multicomponent intervention. Therefore, exercise intervention programs should be prescribed based on an individual's physical functioning and adapted to the ensuing response.",success

As one of the major subtypes of frailty, cognitive frailty is a heterogeneous clinical manifestation characterised by the co-existence of physical decline and cognitive impairment. The occurrence of cognitive frailty increases the risk of adverse health outcomes in older people, affecting their daily functioning and quality of life. However, cognitive frailty is a reversible state, and many interventions have been explored, with exercise interventions playing an important role in the non-pharmacological management of cognitive frailty. This study describes and summarises current exercise interventions for older people with cognitive frailty (including parameters such as mode, frequency and duration of exercise) and identifies the limitations of existing studies to inform future exercise interventions for older people with cognitive frailty. Using a scoping review approach, Chinese and English literature published in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, China Knowledge Network, Wanfang Database, China Biomedical Literature Database (SinoMed) and Vipshop from April 2013, when the definition of cognitive frailty first appeared, to August 2021 was searched to select studies related to exercise interventions for this group, extract information from the included literature, and summarise and report the findings. Nine RCT trial studies and one quasi-experiment study were included, for a total of 10 articles. The exercise modalities involved walking, brisk walking, Otago exercise, resistance exercise, balance training, flexibility training and Baduanjin, etc.; the intensity of exercise was based on individualised guidance and graded exercise intensity; the frequency of exercise was mostly 3-4 times/week; the duration of exercise was mostly 30-60 min/time; compared to the control group, the included studies showed statistically significant improvements in cognitive function, frailty status, and depression with the exercise intervention. There is a paucity of evidence on exercise interventions for older people with cognitive frailty. The evidence provided in this study suggests that exercise interventions may be beneficial for older people with cognitive frailty. However, the existing studies suffer from small sample sizes, short intervention periods, inadequate monitoring of the entire exercise process, and non-uniformity in the assessment of exercise effects. More randomized controlled trials should be conducted in the future to explore the most effective, low-cost and simple interventions to meet the needs of the older people with cognitive frailty.",success

However, physicians face many ethical challenges in end-of-life care. Since the decisions to be made may concern patients' family members and society as well as the patients, it is important to protect the rights, dignity, and vigor of all parties involved in the clinical ethical decision-making process. Understanding the principles underlying biomedical ethics is important for physicians to solve the problems they face in end-of-life care. The main situations that create ethical difficulties for healthcare professionals are the decisions regarding resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, terminal sedation, withholding and withdrawing treatments, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide.

The most common issues that arise are ethical dilemmas around the equivalence of withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment; the doctrine of double effect; the balance between paternalism and shared decision-making; legal challenges around best-interest decisions for patients that lack capacity; conflict resolution; and practical issues during the limitation of treatment. The aim of this article is to address commonly posed questions on these aspects of end-of-life care in the intensive care unit, using best available evidence, and provide practical guidance to critical care clinicians in the UK. With the help of case vignettes, we clarify the disassociation of withdrawing and/or withholding treatment from euthanasia; offer practical suggestions for the use of sedation and analgesia around the end of life, dissipating concerns about hastening death; and advocate for the inclusion of family in decision-making, when the patient does not have capacity.

Patient autonomy is highly valued in the United States to the extent that the patient does not lose the right of self-determination when he or she loses the capacity to make health-care decisions for him or herself. The law has devised several tools to promote ""prospective autonomy."" One mechanism is the instructional advance directive or living will. But most of us do not write such directives. Another mechanism is the proxy directive or durable power of attorney for health care, designating another person, a surrogate, to direct the course of our medical treatment upon our incapacity. But most of us do not do that either. Therefore, the most common mechanism by which our prospective autonomy is protected and promoted is through the informal selection of surrogates based on statutory priority lists. These ""default"" surrogates are the most numerous type of surrogate. This article explains the importance and legal fundamentals of surrogate decision making. It first describes five basic types of surrogates. The article then looks at the role of these surrogates and how they are supposed to make decisions on the patient's behalf. Unfortunately, surrogate performance is often mediocre or poor. There are significant and persistent obstacles to good surrogate decision making.

Patients hospitalized with acute HF were randomized to receive a PC consult with follow-up as determined by provider or standard care. Two hundred thirty-two patients (116 intervention/116 control) from a large tertiary-care urban hospital were recruited over a 10-month period. Primary outcomes were symptom burden, depressive symptoms, and QOL measured at baseline, 1, and 3 months.

PC is appropriate at every stage of disease progression, when PC needs emerge. These needs can be of physical, emotional, social, or spiritual nature. This document encourages the use of validated assessment tools to recognize such needs and ascertain efficacy of management. PC interventions should be provided alongside cardiologic management. Treating breathlessness is more effective, when cardiologic management is supported by PC interventions. Treating other symptoms like pain or depression requires predominantly PC interventions. Advance Care Planning aims to ensure that the future treatment and care the person receives is concordant with their personal values and goals, even after losing decision-making capacity. It should include also disease specific aspects, such as modification of implantable device activity at the end of life. The Whole Person Care concept describes the inseparability of the physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of the human being. Addressing psychological and spiritual needs, together with medical treatment, maintains personal integrity and promotes emotional healing. Most PC concerns can be addressed by the usual care team, supported by a PC specialist if needed. During dying, the persons' needs may change dynamically and intensive PC is often required.

The most prevalent terminal diagnoses were metastatic cancer (22.4%) and end-stage congestive heart failure (20.4%). On average, patients had their devices deactivated 13 months (range: 0 to 62 months) after their terminal diagnosis was established. Once a patient was documented as Do Not Resuscitate (DNR), deactivation was discussed and carried out within a mean time of 38 days (range: 0 to 400 days). Seven patients had their device active for more than 1 month after being documented as DNR. Ten patients (20.4%) received ICD shocks after their terminal diagnosis, 9 received shocks in the month before death, and 2 received shocks after formal DNR orders were in place. Approximately one-third of patients with ICDs received deactivation of their cardioversion/defibrillation therapies as part of their end-of-life care plan. A relatively high proportion of patients (20%) received an ICD shock in the last month of life. In conclusion, addressing device programming needs, including deactivation of cardioversion/defibrillation therapies, should be considered in the context of a patient's goals of care in every patient with an ICD who has a co-existing life-limiting diagnosis.",success

Access to specialty palliative medicine among vascular surgery patients is limited. Here, we aim to describe utilization and impact of formal palliative care consultation for patients receiving major amputations. This is a retrospective, secondary data analysis project examining the records of patients who received major amputations by the vascular surgery team between 2016 and 2021. Demographics, operative, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. The primary outcome variable was palliative care consultation during index admission (the admission in which the patient received their first major amputation). Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and code status at the time of death, if death occurred during the index admission, location of death, and discharge destination. The cohort comprised of 292 patients (39% female, 53% Black, mean age 63), who received a lower extremity major amputation. Most patients (65%) underwent amputation for limb ischemia. One-year mortality after first major amputation was 29%. Average length of stay was 20 days. Thirty-five (12%) patients received a palliative care consultation during the hospitalization in which they received their first major amputation. On multivariable analysis, patients were more likely to receive a palliative care consult during their index admission if they had undergone a thorough knee amputation (OR = 2.89, P = 0.039) or acute limb ischemia (OR = 4.25, P = 0.005). A formal palliative care consult was associated with lower likelihood of in-hospital death and increased likelihood of discharge to hospice (OR = 0.248, P = 0.0167, OR = 1.283, P < 0.001).There were no statistically significant differences in the code status of patients who received a palliative care consultation. In a large academic medical center, palliative medicine consultation was associated with lower in-hospital mortality among patients with advanced vascular disease and major limb amputation. These data will hopefully stimulate much needed prospective research to develop and test tools to identify patients in need and derive evidence about the impact of palliative care services.",success

Most surrogates were surveyed several months to years after making treatment decisions, the majority of which were end-of-life decisions. The quantitative studies found that at least one third of surrogates experienced a negative emotional burden as the result of making treatment decisions. The qualitative studies reported that many or most surrogates experienced negative emotional burden. The negative effects on surrogates were often substantial and typically lasted months or, in some cases, years. The most common negative effects cited by surrogates were stress, guilt over the decisions they made, and doubt regarding whether they had made the right decisions. Nine of the 40 studies also reported beneficial effects on a few surrogates, the most common of which were supporting the patient and feeling a sense of satisfaction. Knowing which treatment is consistent with the patient's preferences was frequently cited as reducing the negative effect on surrogates. Thirty-two of the 40 articles reported data collected in the United States. Because the study populations were relatively homogenous, it is unclear whether the findings apply to other groups. In some cases, the effect of making treatment decisions could not be isolated from that of other stressors, such as grief or prognostic uncertainty. Nine of the studies had a response rate less than 50%, and 9 did not report a response rate. Many of the studies had a substantial interval between the treatment decisions and data collection. Making treatment decisions has a negative emotional effect on at least one third of surrogates, which is often substantial and typically lasts months (or sometimes years).

Methods and Results A retrospective cohort from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2014 was analyzed using the National Inpatient Sample database. Administrative codes for acute myocardial infarction-cardiogenic shock and PCS were used to identify eligible admissions. The primary outcomes were the frequency, utilization trends, and predictors of PCS. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and resources utilization. Multivariable regression and propensity-matching analyses were used to control for confounding. In this 15-year period, there were 444 253 acute myocardial infarction-cardiogenic shock admissions, of which 4.5% received PCS. The cohort receiving PCS was older, of white race, female sex, and with higher comorbidity and acute organ failure. The PCS cohort received fewer cardiac procedures, but more noncardiac organ support therapies. Older age, female sex, white race, higher comorbidity, higher socioeconomic status, admission to a larger hospital, and admission after 2008 were independent predictors of PCS use. Use of PCS was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 6.59 [95% CI 6.37-6.83]; P<0.001). The cohort with PCS use had >2-fold higher in-hospital mortality, 12-fold higher use of do-not-resuscitate status, lesser in-hospital resource utilization, and fewer discharges to home. Similar findings were observed in the propensity-matched cohort. Conclusions PCS use in patients with acute myocardial infarction-cardiogenic shock is low, though there is a trend towards increased adoption. There are significant patient and hospital-specific disparities in the utilization of PCS.",success

To examine the duration of life-support withdrawal and its association with overall family satisfaction with care in the ICU. We studied family members of 584 patients who died in an ICU at 1 of 14 hospitals after withdrawal of life support and for whom complete medical chart and family questionnaires were available. Data concerning six life-sustaining interventions administered during the last 5 days of life were collected. Families were asked to rate their satisfaction with care using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU questionnaire. For nearly half of the patients (271/584), withdrawal of all life-sustaining interventions took more than 1 day. Patients with a prolonged (>1 d) life-support withdrawal were younger, stayed longer in the ICU, had more life-sustaining interventions, had less often a diagnosis of cancer, and had more decision makers involved. Among patients with longer ICU stays, a longer duration in life-support withdrawal was associated with an increase in family satisfaction with care (P = 0.037). Extubation before death was associated with higher family satisfaction with care (P = 0.009). Withdrawal of life support is a complex process that depends on patient and family characteristics.

The aim of this study is to identify patient- and family-related factors associated with dissatisfaction with shared decision-making support among families of neuro-critically ill patients. We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using survey data that had been collected from a consecutive sample of family members of patients in the neuro-ICU (one family member per patient) at two US academic centers. Satisfaction with shared decision-making support on ICU discharge had been measured among family members using one specific Likert scale item on the Family Satisfaction in the ICU 24 survey, a validated survey instrument for families of patients in the ICU. We dichotomized top-box responses for this particular item as an outcome variable and identified available patient- and family-related covariates associated with dissatisfaction (i.e., less than complete satisfaction) via univariate and multivariate analyses. Among 355 surveys, 180 (49.5%) of the surveys indicated dissatisfaction with support during decision-making. In a multivariate model, no preexisting characteristics of families or patients ascertainable on ICU admission were predictive of dissatisfaction. However, among family factors determined during the ICU course, experiencing three or fewer formal family meetings (odds ratio 1.93 [confidence interval 1.13-3.31]; p = 0.01) was significantly predictive of dissatisfaction with decisional support in this cohort with an average patient length of stay of 8.6 days (SD 8.4). There was also a trend toward a family's decision to keep a patient as full code, without treatment limitations, being predictive of dissatisfaction (odds ratio 1.80 [confidence interval 0.93-3.51]; p = 0.08). Family dissatisfaction with neuro-ICU shared decision-making support is not necessarily predicted by any preexisting family or patient variables but appears to correlate with participating in fewer formal family meetings during ICU admission.

Additional testing was needed with patients unable to self-report. The aim of this study was to establish further the reliability and construct validity of a revised RDOS. An observational design was used with 89 consecutive patients referred for inpatient palliative care consultation and at risk for dyspnea who had one or more of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, or pneumonia. Patients were observed and the RDOS scored once each day for up to three days after the initial consultation. Other measures included: dyspnea self-report, neurologic diagnoses, opioid or benzodiazepine use, peripheral oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide level, consciousness, cognitive state, nearness to death, and patient demographics. Perfect interrater reliability across data collectors was achieved. No differences in RDOS scoring were found by patient demographics. RDOS was associated with use of oxygen (p < 0.01), oxygen saturation (p < 0.01) and nearness to death (p < 0.01).

Today, cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET) is recommended in the follow-up of patients with congenital heart diseases (CHDs). Indeed, the maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) and the ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope) correlate with both the prognosis and the quality of life in this population. Atrial septal defects (ASDs) represent the second most frequent CHD and are usually considered as simple CHDs. However, the exercise capacity of ASD patients may be impaired. Therefore, the CPET provides important information in assessment and follow-up of patients with ASDs, for both children and adults. Exercise capacity of patients with unrepaired ASDs depends on the importance of the shunt, the right ventricular (RV) function and volume overload, the level of pulmonary arterial pressure, and the occurrence of arrhythmias. For repaired ASDs, exercise capacity also depends on the delay before closure and the type of procedure (catheter or surgery). In most cases, the exercise capacity is nearly normal and CPET contributes to promote sports participation. In addition, a regular CPET follow-up is necessary to evaluate the occurrence, severity and physiological mechanisms of comorbidities, i.e., heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and arrhythmia.

Thirty-one percent of patients have experienced cardiac death either in the form of mortality or cardiac transplantation. The major cause of death was systemic right ventricular failure. Sixty-five percent have continuing abnormalities of rhythm. Exercise time and workload showed a statistically significant decrease from the original study (Time 1) to both 10-year (Time 2) and 20-year (Time 3) follow-up points. Right ventricular ejection fraction decreased significantly from the Time 1 to Time 2, and again to this current follow-up. Quality of life measures of energy level decreased significantly from the original study to both the Time 2 and Time 3. Cardiac mortality for Mustard patients remains high, and over time, systemic right ventricular ejection fraction, rhythm, exercise tolerance, and quality of life assessments show deterioration.

Rates of change were calculated by linear regression analysis. Right ventricular (RV) function was assessed by echocardiography. Thirty-four patients (22 male) performed 3.5 (range 3-6) CPET with an interval of ≥ 6 months. Mean age at first assessment was 16.4 ± 4.27 years. Follow-up period averaged 6.8 ± 2 years. Exercise capacity was reduced (p<0.0005) and the decline of peak VO2 (-1.3 ± 3.7 %/year; p=0.015) and peak oxygen pulse (-1.4 ± 3.0 %/year; p=0.011) was larger than normal, especially before adulthood and in female patients (p<0.01). During adulthood, RV contractility changes were significantly correlated with the decline of peak oxygen pulse (r= -0.504; p=0.047). In patients with Senning operation for d-TGA, peak VO2 and peak oxygen pulse decrease faster with age compared to healthy controls. This decline is most obvious during childhood and adolescence, and suggests the inability to increase stroke volume to the same extent as healthy peers during growth. Peak VO2 and peak oxygen pulse remain relatively stable during early adulthood. However, when RV contractility decreases, a faster decline in peak oxygen pulse is observed.",success

Up to 70 000 patients may be alive worldwide today with Fontan circulation, and this population is expected to double in the next 20 years. In the absence of a subpulmonary ventricle, Fontan circulation is characterized by chronically elevated systemic venous pressures and decreased cardiac output. The addition of this acquired abnormal circulation to innate abnormalities associated with single-ventricle congenital heart disease exposes these patients to a variety of complications. Circulatory failure, ventricular dysfunction, atrioventricular valve regurgitation, arrhythmia, protein-losing enteropathy, and plastic bronchitis are potential complications of the Fontan circulation. Abnormalities in body composition, bone structure, and growth have been detected. Liver fibrosis and renal dysfunction are common and may progress over time. Cognitive, neuropsychological, and behavioral deficits are highly prevalent.

Furthermore, CPET variables, such as peak oxygen consumption and submaximal variables, have prognostic value and may be used as meaningful endpoints in research studies. CPET is also useful in clinical research applications to assess the effect of pharmacologic or other interventions. Medical therapies to improve exercise tolerance in individuals with a Fontan circulation, such as pulmonary vasodilators, may modestly improve peak oxygen consumption. Exercise training focused on aerobic fitness and lower extremity strength may have a more consistent and larger impact on these measures of aerobic fitness.

After 3.6 ± 1.2 years, 29/120 (25%) normotensive patients developed hypertension. In normotensives, VE/VCO2-slope (p=0.0016) and peak systolic blood pressure (SBP; p=0.049) were significantly related to the development of hypertension during follow-up. Cut-off points related to higher risk for hypertension, based on best sensitivity and specificity, were defined as VE/VCO2-slope ≥ 27 and peak SBP ≥ 220 mmHg. In the hypertensive group, antihypertensive medication was started/extended in 48/101 (48%) patients. Only age was associated with the need to start/extend antihypertensive therapy in this group (p=0.042). Higher VE/VCO2-slope and higher peak SBP are risk factors for the development of hypertension in adults with COA. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing may guide clinical decision making regarding close blood pressure control and preventive lifestyle recommendations.",success
23453444,True,"Journal Article;Multicenter Study;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,,,,,,True,"The determinants of maximal exercise capacity (MEC) in aortic stenosis (AS) are, in large part, unknown. We hypothesized that the left ventricular (LV) global hemodynamic load--as assessed by the valvulo-arterial impedance (Zva)--is one of the main determinants of MEC and we sought to evaluate the factors associated with reduced MEC in AS. Asymptomatic patients with moderate or severe AS (n=62, aortic valve area <1.5 cm(2), 65 ± 13 years, 68% men) and preserved LV systolic function (ejection fraction>50%) were prospectively referred for comprehensive resting echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test. Absolute peak VO2 was 19.5 ± 5.7 mL/kg/min (median 19.6 mL/kg/min; range 7.2-33.1 mL/kg/min). There were significant correlations between peak VO2 and: age, body mass index, LV stroke volumes, cardiac output, mean flow rate, mitral annulus s' and e' wave velocities, E/e' ratio and left atrial diameter (all p<0.05). Indexed mean flow rate and Zva were the strongest univariable echocardiographic determinants of peak VO2 (r=0.44, p<0.001 and r=-0.39, p=0.002, respectively). In addition, patients with reduced MEC (peak VO2<median) had higher Zva than those with preserved MEC (4.24 ± 1.18 vs. 3.71 ± 0.68 mmHg/mL/m(2), p=0.036). In multivariable analysis, age (p<0.001) and Zva (p=0.048) were the only independent predictors (r(2)=0.40) of peak VO2. In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe AS, MEC varies widely among patients, and is often lower than expected. Global LV hemodynamic load is the main echocardiographic determinant of reduced MEC in these patients, suggesting its usefulness for their clinical evaluation and management.",success
10865007,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Although exercise testing is commonly employed to identify adult aortic regurgitation (AR) patients with early left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, the role and value of exercise testing in the management of pediatric AR patients have not been established. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the cardiorespiratory response to exercise of pediatric patients with chronic AR, examine the relation between exercise function and baseline echocardiographic measurements, and identify factors related to diminished exercise capacity (EC). The study group consisted of 26 patients aged 8 to 21 years (mean 14.4 +/- 3.7) with moderate or severe AR referred for exercise physiology testing. All patients underwent a baseline echocardiographic study and a symptom-limited, progressive cycle ergometer exercise test. LV diastolic dimension averaged 120 +/- 12% predicted, systolic dimension 112 +/- 20% predicted, shortening fraction 0.41 +/- 0.07, end-systolic wall stress 65 +/- 23 g/cm(2), and regurgitant fraction 38 +/- 16%. The average EC was 88 +/- 28% (56-143) predicted. No statistically significant correlation was found between EC and any of the echocardiographic parameters studied. Nine patients had EC < 75% predicted. These individuals did not differ from patients with higher EC with regard to any of the echocardiographic parameters or with regard to peak heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory exchange ratio, and incidence of ectopy or ST depression. However, the oxygen pulse at peak exercise (an index proportional to forward stroke volume at peak exercise) was significantly depressed among patients with EC < 75% predicted (77 +/- 6 vs. 106 +/- 16% predicted, p <. 0001). In conclusion, most pediatric patients with moderate or severe AR compensate well for their valve disease, maintain normal forward stroke volume during exercise, and have normal EC. However, a subset of AR patients have diminished EC secondary to an inability to augment forward stroke volume appropriately. These patients cannot be identified on the basis of resting echocardiographic studies. Timely identification of these patients, through formal exercise physiology testing, may have important clinical implications.",success
24524744,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"The management and the clinical decision making in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis are challenging. An ""aggressive"" management, including early aortic valve replacement, is debated in these patients. However, the optimal timing for surgery remains controversial due to the lack of prospective data on the determinants of aortic stenosis progression, multicenter studies on risk stratification, and randomized studies on patient management. Exercise stress testing with or without imaging is strictly contraindicated in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. Exercise stress test is now recommended by current guidelines in asymptomatic patients and may provide incremental prognostic value. Indeed, the development of symptoms during exercise or an abnormal blood pressure response are associated with poor outcome and should be considered as an indication for surgery, as suggested by the most recently updated European Society of Cardiology 2012 guidelines. Exercise stress echocardiography may also improve the risk stratification and identify asymptomatic patients at higher risk of a cardiac event. When the test is combined with imaging, echocardiography during exercise should be recommended rather than post-exercise echocardiography. During exercise, an increase >18 to 20 mm Hg in mean pressure gradient, absence of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (i.e., absence of contractile reserve), and/or a systolic pulmonary arterial pressure >60 mm Hg (i.e., exercise pulmonary hypertension) are suggestive signs of advanced stages of the disease and impaired prognosis. Hence, exercise stress test may identify resting asymptomatic patients who develop exercise abnormalities and in whom surgery is recommended according to current guidelines. Exercise stress echocardiography may further unmask a subset of asymptomatic patients (i.e., without exercise stress test abnormalities) who are at high risk of reduced cardiac event free survival. In these patients, early surgery could be beneficial, whereas regular follow-up seems more appropriate in patients without echocardiographic abnormalities during exercise.",success
23178052,False,Comparative Study;Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"The role of exercise testing to risk stratify patients with repaired coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is controversial. Concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, defined as an increase in the LV mass-to-volume ratio (MVR), is associated with a greater incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. The objective of the present study was to determine whether a hypertensive response to exercise (HRE) is associated with increased LVMVR in patients with repaired CoA. Adults with repaired CoA who had a symptom-limited exercise test and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging examination within 2 years were identified. A hypertensive response to exercise was defined as a peak systolic blood pressure >220 mm Hg during a symptom-limited exercise test. The LV mass and volume were measured using cardiac magnetic resonance by an investigator who was unaware of patient status. We included 47 patients (median age 27.3 years, interquartile range 19.8 to 37.3), who had undergone CoA repair at a median age of 4.6 years (interquartile range 0.4 to 15.7). Those with (n = 11) and without (n = 36) HRE did not differ in age, age at repair, body surface area, arm-to-leg systolic blood pressure gradient, gender, or peak oxygen uptake with exercise. Those with a HRE had a greater mean systolic blood pressure at rest (146 ± 18 vs 137 ± 18 mm Hg, p = 0.04) and greater median LVMVR (0.85, interquartile range 0.7 to 1, vs 0.66, interquartile range 0.6 to 0.7; p = 0.04) than those without HRE. Adjusting for systolic blood pressure at rest, age, age at repair, and gender, the relation between HRE and LVMVR remained significant (p = 0.001). In conclusion, HRE was associated with increased LVMVR, even after adjusting for multiple covariates.",success
29691159,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Exercise-testing may be a more tolerable method of detecting hypertension in children after coarctation repair compared to gold-standard 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM). This study aims to determine the prevalence of exercise-induced hypertension and end-organ damage in children after coarctation repair, and the effectiveness of exercise-testing compared to 24-hour ABPM in this population. Exercise-testing (Bruce protocol), transthoracic echocardiogram, 24-hour ABPM, and pulse wave velocity were performed in 41 patients aged 8 to 18 years with previous coarctation repair. Median age at repair was 13 days. Exercise-testing data were compared to healthy paediatric controls. Hypertension was defined as BP >95th percentile on 24-hour ABPM compared to normalised data, and systolic BP (SBP) arbitrarily >200mmHg on exercise-testing. After 13±3years, 39% (14/36) were hypertensive on 24-hour ABPM and 12% (5/41) on exercise-testing. Coarctation patients had a higher peak exercise SBP and reduced endurance compared to controls (164±26mmHg vs. 148±19mmHg, p=0.003; and 13.0±1.7mins vs. 14.2±2.4mins, p=0.007; respectively). All patients with a peak exercise SBP >190mmHg were hypertensive on 24-hour ABPM. Pulse wave velocity was higher in hypertensive patients on exercise-testing and 24-hour ABPM compared to normotensive patients (p=0.004 and p=0.06; respectively). Exercise-testing may be a useful tool to detect hypertension in children and young adults after coarctation repair, particularly in those who do not tolerate 24-hour ABPM. Normative peak exercise BP data for age should be obtained to improve the accuracy of exercise-testing in detecting hypertension.",success
25151284,False,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;Review",,,,,,,,True,"The role of exercise testing and stress imaging in the management of patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) is reviewed in this article. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology/European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery have recently put emphasis on the role of exercise testing to clarify symptom status and the use of stress imaging to assess the dynamic component of valvular abnormalities and unmask subclinical myocardial dysfunction that could be missed at rest. Recent studies have demonstrated the incremental prognostic value of exercise echocardiography for asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, moderate-severe mitral stenosis, and severe primary mitral regurgitation. In patients with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis, dobutamine stress echocardiography is recommended to differentiate true severe from pseudosevere aortic stenosis. Data on the prognostic value of stress echocardiography in aortic regurgitation and functional mitral regurgitation are less robust. Data are sparse on the use of stress imaging in right-sided VHD, however recent studies using stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging offer some prognostic information. Although the strongest recommendations for surgical treatment continue to be based on symptom status and resting left ventricular repercussions, stress imaging can be useful to optimize risk stratification and timing of surgery in VHD. Randomized clinical trials are required to confirm that clinical decision-making based on stress imaging can lead to improved outcomes.",success
