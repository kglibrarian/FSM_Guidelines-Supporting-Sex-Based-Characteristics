End-stage liver disease (ESLD) patients are at a particularly increased risk for development of CIAKI following coronary angiography due to preexisting renal hypoperfusion. <b>Methods</b>: We performed a retrospective study of 544 consecutive cardiac catheterizations in ESLD patients from December 2003 to May 2013 to calculate the incidence of CIAKI post-coronary angiography and to identify risk factors for CIAKI. CIAKI was defined as a serum creatinine increase of either ≥ 25% or ≥ 0.5 mg/dL from baseline within 72 hours. Multivariable and Cox regression analysis was performed for development of CIAKI and all-cause mortality, respectively. <b>Results</b>: Overall, 179 cases of coronary angiography were included in the final analysis. CIAKI occurred in 23% of patients. All-cause mortality was 52% in the CIAKI group and 37% in the non-CIAKI group, with a mean follow-up of 2.2 <b>± </b>3.8<b> </b>years.

24648247,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Limited data regarding the optimal risk assessment strategy for evaluating candidates for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) exist. Our center has adopted a policy of performing cardiac catheterization (CATH) in patients with predefined risk factors, and this is followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when it is indicated, even in the presence of negative stress test findings. The aim of this single-center, retrospective study of all patients who underwent OLT between 2000 and 2010 was to assess the effect of our policy on cardiovascular (CV) complications and survival rates after OLT. Data, including 1-year all-cause and CV mortality, postoperative myocardial infarctions (MIs), and frequencies of CATH and PCI, were abstracted. The study was divided into 3 subperiods to reflect the changes in policy over this period: (A) 2000-2004, (B) 2005-2008, and (C) 2009-2010. One thousand two hundred twenty-one patients underwent OLT between 2000 and 2010. The rate of catheterization increased during the 3 time periods (P < 0.001), as did the rate of PCI (P < 0.05). All-cause mortality decreased over the periods (P < 0.001), as did the MI rate (P < 0.001). Thirty-five of the 57 patients requiring PCI had normal stress tests. The mortality rate associated with postoperative MIs was significantly higher than the overall all-cause mortality rate. In conclusion, a significant improvement in the overall survival rate over the 3 analyzed time periods was noted. Increases in the frequencies of CATH and PCI corresponded to significant reductions in postoperative MIs and 1-year all-cause mortality rates. The increased use of CATH and PCI was associated with reduced overall all-cause mortality through reductions in the incidence of both fatal and nonfatal MIs. Further analyses of the role of stress testing and CATH in evaluating and treating patients before OLT are required to optimize this process.",success

30986390,False,Journal Article;Practice Guideline;Review,,,,,,,,True,"This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. The intent is to evaluate the current data on mechanism of altered coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, provide guidance on the use of currently available testing of the coagulation cascade, and help practitioners use anticoagulation and pro-coagulants appropriately in patients with cirrhosis. This review is framed around the best practice points, which were derived from the most impactful publications in the area of coagulation in cirrhosis and agreed to by all authors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Global tests of clot formation, such as rotational thromboelastometry, thromboelastography, sonorheometry, and thrombin generation, may eventually have a role in the evaluation of clotting in patients with cirrhosis, but currently lack validated target levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: In general, clinicians should not routinely correct thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy before low-risk therapeutic paracentesis, thoracentesis, and routine upper endoscopy for variceal ligation in patients with hepatic synthetic dysfunction-induced coagulation abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunization, and/or transfusion reactions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimize clot formation in advanced liver disease: hematocrit ≥25%, platelet count >50,000, and fibrinogen >120 mg/dL. Commonly utilized thresholds for international normalized ratio correction are not supported by evidence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Thrombopoietin agonists are a good alternative to platelet transfusion, but require time (about 10 days) to elevate platelet levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary international normalized ratio target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the utility of this agent significantly. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate contains both pro- and anticoagulant factors that offer an attractive low-volume therapeutic to rebalance a disturbed hemostatic system. However, dosage is, in part, based on international normalized ratio, which is problematic in cirrhosis, and published experience in liver disease is limited. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Anti-fibrinolytic therapy may be considered in patients with persistent bleeding from mucosal oozing or puncture wound bleeding consistent with impaired clot integrity. Both ε-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid inhibit clot dissolution. Neither is believed to generate a hypercoagulable state, although both may exacerbate pre-existing thrombi. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Desmopressin releases von Willebrand factor as its primary hemostatic mechanism. As this factor is usually elevated in cirrhosis, the agent lacks a sound evidence-based foundation, but may be useful in patients with concomitant renal failure. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Systemic heparin infusion is recommended for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis, but there are unresolved issues regarding monitoring with both the anti-Xa assay and the partial thromboplastin time due to cirrhosis-related antithrombin deficiency (heparin cofactor). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Treatment of incidental portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis depends on estimated impact on transplantation surgical complexity vs risks of bleeding and falls. Therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, and direct-acting anticoagulants improve portal vein repermeation vs observation alone. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Direct-acting anticoagulants, such as the factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors, are relatively safe and effective in stable cirrhotic patients, but are in need of further study in patients with more advanced liver disease.",success

We sought to describe the safety and feasibility of TR cardiac catheterization in liver transplant candidates (LTCs). We retrospectively reviewed 1,071 consecutive cases of TR cardiac catheterization in 1,045 patients from May 2008 to December 2011 at a single institution. The primary end point was radial approach failure. Ten percent of TR cases (n = 107) were performed in LTCs and 90% (n = 964) were performed in non-LTCs. The LTC group had lower rates of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors. The LTC group had a significantly lower platelet count (75,000 vs 237,000/mm(3), p <0.01), higher international normalized ratio (1.7 vs 1.1, p <0.01), and lower mean arterial pressure (78 vs 89 mm Hg, p <0.01). The mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 21 in LTCs. Percutaneous coronary interventions were performed in 4% of LTCs and 15% of non-LTCs (p <0.01). The radial approach failure rate was 10% in LTCs and 7% in non-LTCs (p = 0.15). In conclusion, radial approach failure was similar between the LTC and non-LTC groups. Despite significant differences in platelet count and international normalized ratio, there was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the groups, suggesting that TR cardiac catheterization is safe and effective in LTCs.",success

Markers of CVD risk in 65 LTRs with no known history of diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, or ischemic heart disease were compared to age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls with no chronic medical disease. LTRs on corticosteroids or those with graft cirrhosis (GC) were excluded. The effect of calcineurin inhibitors on the CVD risk profile was separately analyzed in LTRs receiving either tacrolimus (Tac) or cyclosporine A (CsA). To evaluate the impact of GC, a comparison was made between LTRs with and without GC. Non-DM LTRs were matched to controls with respect to age, sex, and BMI. LTRs had similar serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and total cholesterol in comparison with BMI-matched controls. Proatherogenic small-dense (sd) LDL-C (33.6 ± 14 versus 25.9 ± 9.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001) and %sdLDL-C (30% ± 10% versus 26.4% ± 9%; P = 0.02) were significantly higher in LTRs.

In comparison with those with preserved graft function, LTRs with GC had lower levels of serum atherogenic markers characterized by low sdLDL-C, apoB, triglycerides, LDL-C, and total cholesterol. In conclusion, LTRs have a proatherogenic lipoprotein profile that is not captured with a traditional lipid panel, and this suggests that a detailed serum atherogenic profile is needed to truly assess CVD risk in LTRs.",success

Although LT is associated with dyslipidemia, particularly atherogenic lipoprotein subparticles, the impact of these subparticles on CVD-related events is unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of small dense (sdLDL-C) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) on CVD events. Prospectively enrolled patients (N = 130) had detailed lipid profile consisting of traditional lipid parameters and sdLDL-C and were followed for CVD events. The primary endpoint was a CVD composite consisting of myocardial infarction (MI), angina, need for coronary revascularization, and cardiac death. Mean age of the cohort was 58 ± 11 years, and the most common etiology of liver disease (LD) was hepatitis C virus (N = 48) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (N = 23). A total of 20 CVD events were noted after median follow-up of 45 months. The baseline traditional profile was similar in patients with and without CVD events. A serum LDL-C cutoff of 100 mg/dL was unable to identify individuals at risk of a CVD event (P = 0.86). In contrast, serum concentration of atherogenic sdLDL-C >25 mg/dL was predictive of CVD events with a hazard ratio of 6.376 (95% confidence interval, 2.65, 15.34; P < 0.001). This relationship was independent of diabetes, hypertension, sex, ethnicity, LD, obesity, and statin use. Conclusion: sdLDL-C independently predicted CVD events whereas LDL-C did not. Thus, sdLDL-C may provide a useful clinical tool in risk stratifying and managing patients after LT.",success

The authors hypothesized that this underutilization could stem in part from fear of liver damage caused by statins. The purpose was to determine whether concern about hepatotoxicity acts as a barrier among primary care physicians to prescribing statins for patients with elevated liver transaminase values and/or underlying liver disease. The survey included 937 primary care physicians from 138 academic centers in the United States, and the following were measured: (1) comparison of statin prescribing for patients with clinical indications and (a) no mention of liver transaminase values, (b) elevated liver transaminase values and (c) underlying liver disease; (2) correlation between perception of statin hepatotoxicity and statin prescribing. Seventy-one percent of respondents would prescribe statins in scenario 1, (45-year-old woman with low-density lipoprotein 240 mg/dL), whereas only 50% would prescribe statins if the baseline liver transaminase values were elevated to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (P < 0.001). This prescribing rate dropped even further to 40% in scenario 3 (55-year-old man with known coronary disease, low-density lipoprotein 250 mg/dL and hepatitis C). Thirty-seven percent of respondents had falsely elevated perceptions of statin hepatotoxicity risk, and these perceptions correlated inversely with statin prescribing. The method of survey administration prevented calculation of response rate, possibility of response bias exists. Despite extensive data documenting safety of statins, primary care physicians harbor significant hepatotoxicity concerns, and these concerns act as a barrier to statin utilization.",success

Among their recommendations was that regulatory agencies reconsider the statin-labeling recommendation at that time, which required post-statin liver enzyme testing. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration altered statin labeling such that unless clinically indicated for other reasons, after a pre-statin therapy baseline evaluation, follow-up liver enzyme testing was not uniformly required after statin initiation. This 2014 report provides an update on interim issues relevant to statins and liver safety. Some of the points discussed include the value of baseline liver enzymes before initiating statin therapy, safety of statin use in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, potential drug interactions between statins and drugs used to treat hepatitis, the use of statins in liver transplant recipients, and the use of statins in patients with autoimmune liver disease.

We performed a multicenter, double-blind, parallel trial of 158 patients with cirrhosis receiving standard prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding (a β-blocker and band ligation) in Spain from October 2010 through October 2013. Within 10 days of bleeding, subjects were randomly assigned, but stratified by Child-Pugh class of A or B vs C, to groups given simvastatin (20 mg/d the first 15 days, 40 mg/d thereafter; n = 69) or placebo (n = 78). Patients were followed for as long as 24 months. The primary end point was a composite of rebleeding and death, and main secondary end points were the individual components of the composite (death and rebleeding).

Optimal CAD medical management was defined as the use of both statin and aspirin, unless a contraindication was documented. Impact of these medications on hepatic decompensation, renal function, gastrointestinal bleeding, and need for transfusion was evaluated. CAD was detected in 84/228 (36.8%) patients. Lipid profile was similar in patients with and without CAD. In patients with CAD, statins were started in 19 (23%), while aspirin was used in 30 (36%) patients. In patients with obstructive or multivessel CAD, statin therapy was used only in 41% and 65%, respectively. Statins were more likely to be prescribed in patients with diabetes (32% versus 15%, P = 0.05) and history of dyslipidemia (38% versus 15%, P = 0.02).

Clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), defined by a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) ≥10 mm Hg, is the strongest predictor of decompensation. This study aimed at assessing whether lowering HVPG with β blockers could decrease the risk of decompensation or death in compensated cirrhosis with CSPH. This study on β blockers to prevent decompensation of cirrhosis with portal hypertension (PREDESCI) was an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomised controlled trial done in eight hospitals in Spain. We enrolled patients with compensated cirrhosis and CSPH without high-risk varices. All participants had HVPG measurements with assessment of acute HVPG-response to intravenous propranolol. Responders (HVPG-decrease ≥10%) were randomly assigned to propranolol (up to 160 mg twice a day) versus placebo and non-responders to carvedilol (≤25 mg/day) versus placebo. Doses were individually determined during an open-label titration period after which randomisation was done with 1:1 allocation by a centralised web-based system. The primary endpoint was incidence of cirrhosis decompensation (defined as development of ascites, bleeding, or overt encephalopathy) or death. Since death in compensated cirrhosis is usually unrelated to the liver, an intention-to-treat analysis considering deaths unrelated to the liver as competing events was done. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01059396. The trial is now completed. Between Jan 18, 2010, and July 31, 2013, 631 patients were evaluated and 201 were randomly assigned. 101 patients received placebo and 100 received active treatment (67 propranolol and 33 carvedilol). The primary endpoint occurred in 16 (16%) of 100 patients in the β blockers group versus 27 (27%) of 101 in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·51, 95% CI 0·26-0·97, p=0·041). The difference was due to a reduced incidence of ascites (HR=0·44, 95%CI=0·20-0·97, p=0·0297). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups. Six patients (four in the β blockers group) had severe adverse events. Long-term treatment with β blockers could increase decompensation-free survival in patients with compensated cirrhosis and CSPH, mainly by reducing the incidence of ascites.

The objective of this study was to examine predicted preferences of patients and physicians for the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage. Untreated patients with newly diagnosed esophageal varices and practicing gastroenterologists were enrolled in this study. Patients with contraindications to either EVL or beta-blockers were excluded. Predicted preferences for treatment were evaluated with an interactive computer task designed to elicit subjects' trade-offs related to the route of administration, risk of fatigue, sexual dysfunction, dysphagia, shortness of breath and/or hypotension, procedure-related bleeding, and perforation. Fifty-three patients and 61 physicians were enrolled. Thirty-four (64%) patients and 35 (57%) physicians preferred EVL over beta-blockers. Patients' predicted preferences were most strongly influenced by the risks of shortness of breath or hypotension, fatigue, and procedure-related bleeding, whereas physicians placed greater importance on procedure-related bleeding, sexual dysfunction, and perforation. Forty-eight patients were prescribed beta-blockers, two were not given prophylaxis, and three were lost to follow-up. Predicted treatment preferences among both patients and physicians for primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage vary significantly. Physicians in this study preferring EVL stated that they prescribe beta-blockers as first-line therapy in order to remain compliant with guidelines. Physicians should discuss both EVL and beta-blockers with patients requiring primary prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage. Future guidelines should incorporate individual patient preferences.",success

Two independent reviewers performed trial selection and quality assessment. An individual patient meta-analysis based on the data of three studies was performed. From 193 citations, 19 controlled trials (n=678) were included. When compared to placebo, ARB/ACEi resulted in significant HVPG reduction. The best quality trials compared ARB/ACEi to beta-blockers (BB). Pooled individual patient data for three of four of these trials showed that BB decreased the HVPG more than ARB/ACEi. In patients with Child Pugh A cirrhosis, the HVPG reduction with ARB/ACEi (-17%; 95% CI: -28 to -6), was similar to that of BB (-21%; 95% CI: -32 to -9). Significant variation in the comparison groups of AA trials precluded pooling. There was no difference in adverse events in any group but selected studies noted adverse hemodynamic effects in decompensated patients on ARB/ACEi. ARB/ACEi reduce portal pressure in patients with Child Pugh A cirrhosis without adverse events. The efficacy and safety in this group may be secondary to a targeted effect on the local hepatic RAAS system, as compared to decompensated patients who risk hypotension and renal insufficiency due to activation of the systemic RAAS.

A strict protocol for performing CATH based upon predefined risk factors, rather than noninvasive testing alone, was applied to a subgroup (2009-2010) from that study. CATH was followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in cases of significant coronary artery disease (CAD; ≥50% stenosis). The current study applies this screening protocol to a larger cohort (2010-2016) to assess post-LT clinical outcomes. Among 811 LT patients, 766 underwent stress testing (94%) and 559 underwent CATH (69%), of whom 10% had CAD requiring PCI. The sensitivity of stress echocardiography in detecting significant CAD was 37%. Predictors of PCI included increasing age, male gender, and personal history of CAD (P < 0.05 for all).

Patients enrolled in the prospective multicenter post-market XIENCE V USA study will be used as historical control group in a stratified propensity-adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The XIENCE Short DAPT Program will provide insights into the safety and efficacy of 2 abbreviated DAPT regimens of 3- and 1-month duration in a large cohort of HBR patients undergoing PCI with the XIENCE stent.",success

Forty-four patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (16 patients), valve surgery (16 patients), a combination of the 2 procedures (10 patients), or pericardiectomy (2 patients). Twelve patients (27%) developed hepatic decompensation, and 7 patients (16%) died.

The association of hepatic decompensation and mortality with Child-Pugh class, Child-Pugh score, and MELD score was significant (P < 0.005). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for mortality were similar for Child-Pugh (0.84 +/- 0.09) and MELD scores (0.87 +/- 0.09).

To evaluate whether medical student burnout differs by sexual orientation and whether this association is mediated by experiences of mistreatment. This cross-sectional study surveyed US medical students graduating from Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)-accredited US allopathic medical schools who responded to the AAMC graduation questionnaire in 2016 and 2017. Statistical analyses were performed from March 15, 2019, to July 2, 2020, and from November 20 to December 9, 2020. Burnout was measured using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory for Medical Students, and sexual orientation was categorized as either heterosexual or lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB). Logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate the association between sexual orientation and experiencing burnout (defined as being in the top quartile of exhaustion and disengagement burnout dimensions) and to test the mediating association of mistreatment. From 2016 to 2017, 30 651 students completed the AAMC Graduation Questionnaire, and 26 123 responses were analyzed. Most respondents were younger than 30 years (82.9%) and White (60.3%).

Compared with heterosexual students, a greater proportion of LGB students reported experiencing mistreatment in all categories, including humiliation (27.0% LGB students vs 20.7% heterosexual students; P < .001), mistreatment not specific to identity (17.0% vs 10.3%; P < .001), and mistreatment specific to gender (27.3% vs 17.9%; P < .001), race/ethnicity (11.9% vs 8.6%; P < .001), and sexual orientation (23.3% vs 1.0%; P < .001). Being LGB was associated with increased odds of burnout (adjusted odds ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.41-1.89]); this association persisted but was attenuated after adjusting for mistreatment (odds ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.16-1.60]).

Of 7905 participating surgeons, 700 (8.9%) reported concern they had made a major medical error in the last 3 months. Over 70% of surgeons attributed the error to individual rather than system level factors. Reporting an error during the last 3 months had a large, statistically significant adverse relationship with mental QOL, all 3 domains of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment) and symptoms of depression. Each one point increase in depersonalization (scale range, 0-33) was associated with an 11% increase in the likelihood of reporting an error while each one point increase in emotional exhaustion (scale range, 0-54) was associated with a 5% increase. Burnout and depression remained independent predictors of reporting a recent major medical error on multivariate analysis that controlled for other personal and professional factors. The frequency of overnight call, practice setting, method of compensation, and number of hours worked were not associated with errors on multivariate analysis.

Associations of an error with quality of life, burnout, empathy, and symptoms of depression were determined using generalized estimating equations for repeated measures. Thirty-four percent of participants reported making at least 1 major medical error during the study period.

Culture, overall, played a lesser role than hypothesized. However, a cultural emphasis on quality played a key role in both quality outcomes. Further, we found that stressed, burned out, and dissatisfied physicians do report a greater likelihood of making errors and more frequent instance of suboptimal patient care. Creating and sustaining a cultural emphasis on quality is not an easy task, but is worthwhile for patients, physicians, and health care organizations.

Burnout is a syndrome characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced effectiveness. Physician burnout has been shown to influence quality of care, patient safety, physician turnover, and patient satisfaction. Although burnout is a system issue, most institutions operate under the erroneous framework that burnout and professional satisfaction are solely the responsibility of the individual physician. Engagement is the positive antithesis of burnout and is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption in work. There is a strong business case for organizations to invest in efforts to reduce physician burnout and promote engagement.

Although there is a strong moral and ethical case for organizations to address physician burnout, financial principles (eg, return on investment) can also be applied to determine the economic cost of burnout and guide appropriate investment to address the problem. The business case to address physician burnout is multifaceted and includes costs associated with turnover, lost revenue associated with decreased productivity, as well as financial risk and threats to the organization's long-term viability due to the relationship between burnout and lower quality of care, decreased patient satisfaction, and problems with patient safety. Nearly all US health care organizations have used similar evidence to justify their investments in safety and quality.

A retrospective review of administrative data was done to evaluate a natural quasi-experiment in a network of publicly funded primary care clinics. Physicians in 6 of 11 clinics were given a financial incentive twice the size of the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' incentive for achieving group targets in preventive care that included cervical cancer screening, mammography, and pediatric immunization. They also received productivity incentives. Six years of performance indicators were compared between incentivized and nonincentivized clinics. We also surveyed the incentivized clinicians about their perception of the incentive program. Although some performance indicators improved for all measures and all clinics, there were no clinically significant differences between clinics that had incentives and those that did not. A linear trend test approached conventional significance levels for Papanicolaou smears (P = .08) but was of very modest magnitude compared with observed nonlinear variations; there was no suggestion of a linear trend for mammography or pediatric immunizations. The survey revealed that most physicians felt the incentives were not very effective in improving quality of care. We found no evidence for a clinically significant effect of financial incentives on performance of preventive care in these community health centers.

This statement highlights the importance of recognizing APOs when CVD risk is evaluated in women, although their value in reclassifying risk may not be established. A history of APOs is a prompt for more vigorous primordial prevention of CVD risk factors and primary prevention of CVD. Adopting a heart-healthy diet and increasing physical activity among women with APOs, starting in the postpartum setting and continuing across the life span, are important lifestyle interventions to decrease CVD risk. Lactation and breastfeeding may lower a woman's later cardiometabolic risk. Black and Asian women experience a higher proportion APOs, with more severe clinical presentation and worse outcomes, than White women. More studies on APOs and CVD in non-White women are needed to better understand and address these health disparities. Future studies of aspirin, statins, and metformin may better inform our recommendations for pharmacotherapy in primary CVD prevention among women who have had an APO. Several opportunities exist for health care systems to improve transitions of care for women with APOs and to implement strategies to reduce their long-term CVD risk. One proposed strategy includes incorporation of the concept of a fourth trimester into clinical recommendations and health care policy.",success

Although the incidence of VAs has declined in the hospital phase of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), mainly due to prompt revascularization and optimal medical therapy, still up to 6% patients with ACS develop ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation within the first hours of ACS symptoms. Despite sustained VAs being perceived predictors of worse in-hospital outcomes, specific associations between the type of VAs, arrhythmia timing, applied treatment strategies and long-term prognosis in AMI are vague. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common supraventricular tachyarrhythmia that may be asymptomatic and/or may be associated with rapid haemodynamic deterioration requiring immediate treatment. It is estimated that over 20% AMI patients may have a history of AF, whereas the new-onset arrhythmia may occur in 5% patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction. Importantly, patients who were treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention for AMI and developed AF have higher rates of adverse events and mortality compared with subjects free of arrhythmia.

The SISQs were compared against reference standards to determine sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for alcohol and drug use. Among the 459 participants, 22 % reported unhealthy alcohol use and 25 % reported drug use in the past year. The SISQ-alcohol had sensitivity of 73.3 % (95 % CI 65.3-80.3) and specificity of 84.7 % (95 % CI 80.2-88.5), AUC = 0.79 (95 % CI 0.75-0.83), for detecting unhealthy alcohol use, and sensitivity of 86.7 % (95 % CI 75.4-94.1) and specificity of 74.2 % (95 % CI 69.6-78.4), AUC = 0.80 (95 % CI 0.76-0.85), for alcohol use disorder.

Stigmatizing language can worsen addiction-related stigma and outcomes. Although non-professional terminology may be used by individuals with addiction, the role of clinicians, educators, researchers, policymakers, and community and cultural leaders is to actively work toward destigmatization of addiction and its treatment, in part through the use of non-stigmatizing language. Role-modeling better approaches can help us move away from the inaccurate, outdated view of addiction as a character flaw or moral failing deserving of punishment, and toward that of a chronic disease requiring long-term treatment. Non-stigmatizing, non-judgmental, medically-based terminology and the adoption of person-first language can facilitate improved communication as well as patient access to and engagement with addiction care. Person-first language, which shifts away from defining a person through the lens of disease (eg, the term ""a person with addiction"" is recommended over the terms ""addict"" or ""addicted patient""), implicitly acknowledges that a patient's life extends beyond a given disease. While such linguistic changes may seem subtle, they communicate that addiction, chronic pain and other diseases are only one aspect of a person's health and quality of life, and can promote therapeutic relationships, reduce stigma and health and disparities in addiction care.

All cause and cause specific crude mortality rates (per 1000 person years) to determine absolute risk of mortality and all cause age and sex standardised mortality ratios to determine relative risk of mortality compared with the general population. Mortality risk was calculated according to treatment status (on OAT, off OAT), time since starting and stopping treatment (1, 2, 3-4, 5-12, >12 weeks), and medication type (methadone, buprenorphine/naloxone). Adjusted risk ratios compared the relative risk of mortality on and off OAT over time as fentanyl became more prevalent in the illicit drug supply. 7030 (12.7%) of 55 347 OAT recipients died during follow-up. The all cause standardised mortality ratio was substantially lower on OAT (4.6, 95% confidence interval 4.4 to 4.8) than off OAT (9.7, 9.5 to 10.0). In a period of increasing prevalence of fentanyl, the relative risk of mortality off OAT was 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.4) times higher than on OAT before the introduction of fentanyl, increasing to 3.4 (2.8 to 4.3) at the end of the study period (65% increase in relative risk). Retention on OAT is associated with substantial reductions in the risk of mortality for people with opioid use disorder. The protective effect of OAT on mortality increased as fentanyl and other synthetic opioids became common in the illicit drug supply, whereas the risk of mortality remained high off OAT.

Pooled all cause mortality rates were 11.3 and 36.1 per 1000 person years in and out of methadone treatment (unadjusted out-to-in rate ratio 3.20, 95% confidence interval 2.65 to 3.86) and reduced to 4.3 and 9.5 in and out of buprenorphine treatment (2.20, 1.34 to 3.61). In pooled trend analysis, all cause mortality dropped sharply over the first four weeks of methadone treatment and decreased gradually two weeks after leaving treatment. All cause mortality remained stable during induction and remaining time on buprenorphine treatment. Overdose mortality evolved similarly, with pooled overdose mortality rates of 2.6 and 12.7 per 1000 person years in and out of methadone treatment (unadjusted out-to-in rate ratio 4.80, 2.90 to 7.96) and 1.4 and 4.6 in and out of buprenorphine treatment.<b>Conclusions</b> Retention in methadone and buprenorphine treatment is associated with substantial reductions in the risk for all cause and overdose mortality in people dependent on opioids.

All Massachusetts residents aged 18 to 64 years with a first hospitalization for IDU-IE were included; IDU-IE was defined as any hospitalization with a diagnosis of endocarditis and at least 1 claim in the prior 6 months for OUD, drug use, or hepatitis C and with 2-month survival after hospital discharge. Data were analyzed from November 11, 2018, to June 23, 2020. Receipt of MOUD, defined as any treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone, within 3 months after hospital discharge excluding discharge month for IDU-IE. The main outcome was all-cause mortality. The proportion of patients who received MOUD in the 3 months after hospital discharge was calculated. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association of MOUD receipt with mortality, adjusting for sex, age, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and homelessness. In the secondary analysis, receipt of MOUD was considered as a monthly time-varying exposure. Of 679 individuals with IDU-IE, 413 (60.8%) were male, the mean (SD) age was 39.2 (12.1) years, 298 (43.9%) were aged 18 to 34 years, 419 (72.3) had mental illness, and 209 (30.8) experienced homelessness. A total of 134 individuals (19.7%) received MOUD in the 3 months before hospitalization and 165 (24.3%) in the 3 months after hospital discharge. Of those who received MOUD after discharge, 112 (67.9%) received buprenorphine. The crude mortality rate was 9.2 deaths per 100 person-years. MOUD receipt within 3 months after discharge was not associated with reduced mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.61-2.72); however, MOUD receipt was associated with reduced mortality in the month that MOUD was received (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.89). In this cohort study, receipt of MOUD was associated with reduced mortality after hospitalization for injection drug use-associated endocarditis only in the month it was received.

Although outpatient treatment with medications for opioid use disorder reduces overdose risk and recurrent infections, hospitalisation remains common. We evaluated the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of hospital-based strategies to address the US opioid epidemic. We developed a microsimulation model to compare the cost-effectiveness of: standard hospital care-detoxification for opioids, no addiction consult service (status quo); expanded inpatient prescribing of medications for opioid use disorder, including bridge prescriptions (ie, medication until they can see an outpatient provider) when possible (medications for opioid use disorder with bridge); implementation of addiction consult services within the hospital (addiction consult services alone); and a combined medication for opioid use disorder with addiction consult services strategy (combined). We used clinical trials and observational cohorts to inform model inputs. Outcomes were life-years, discounted costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, hospitalisations, and deaths. We did deterministic sensitivity analyses on key model inputs related to costs and sequelae of drug use and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to further address uncertainty. Among people who inject opioids in the USA, we estimated that expanding medications for opioid use disorder with bridge prescriptions would reduce hospitalisations and overdose deaths by 3·2% and 3·6%, respectively, and the combination of expanded medications with opioid use disorder along with addiction consult sevices would reduce hospitalisations and overdoses by 5·2% and 6·6%, respectively, compared with the status quo. Mean lifetime costs ranged from US$731 400 (95% credible interval 447 911-859 189 for the medications for opioid use disorder strategy) to $741 200 (470 930-868 551 for the combined strategy) per person. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per life-year gained, medications for opioid use disorder with bridge and combined strategies were cost-effective ($7600 and $14 300, respectively). A scenario that assumed ideal access to harm reduction services came to the same conclusions as the base case and our results were robust in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The combined interventions of expanding hospital-based prescribing of medications for opioid use disorder and implementing addiction consult services could improve life expectancy, be cost-effective, and could be the basis for a comprehensive hospital-based strategy for addressing the opioid epidemic in the USA and countries with similar opioid epidemics.

Dose escalation prior to rifampicin initiation was not required and resulted in an increase in subjects with supra-therapeutic concentrations. However, during rifampicin cessation, a dose reduction of 10 mg every 2 days commencing prior to rifampicin cessation, ensured that most patients possessed a peak methadone plasma concentration within an optimal therapeutic window.

This study aimed to project whether penicillin allergy testing in patients reporting a penicillin allergy is cost-saving. In this economic evaluation study, we built decision models to project the economic impact of 2 strategies for a patient with a penicillin allergy label: (1) perform diagnostic testing (drug challenges, with or without skin tests); and (2) do not perform diagnostic testing. The health service perspective was adopted, considering costs with penicillin allergy tests, and with hospital bed-days/outpatient visits, antibiotic use, and diagnostic testing. Twenty-four base case decision models were built, accounting for differences in the diagnostic workup, setting (inpatient vs outpatient) and geographic region. Uncertainty was explored via probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Penicillin allergy testing was cost-saving in all decision models built. For models assessing the performance of both skin tests and drug challenges, allergy testing resulted in average savings (in United States [US] dollars) of $657 for inpatients (US: $1444; Europe: $489) and $2746 for outpatients (US: $256; Europe: $6045). 75% of simulations obtained through probabilistic sensitivity analysis identified testing as the less costly option.

All patients with IE surgically treated at Cleveland Clinic from July 1, 2007 to July 1, 2012 were identified from the Cleveland Clinic Infective Endocarditis Registry and the Cardiovascular Information Registry. Of 536 patients operated on for IE during the study period, 41 (8%) actively injected drugs. The primary outcome of the study was death or reoperation for IE. Patients who injected drugs had poorer survival free of reoperation, and the risk of events varied with time. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, using time-dependent covariates, IDU was associated with a higher hazard of death or reoperation between 90 and 180 days (hazard ratio [HR], 9.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-35.3) but not before 90 days (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.05-3.1) or after 180 days (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.8-3.8). Among patients who injected drugs, reoperation and death contributed equally to the outcome, whereas among patients who did not inject drugs, reoperation for IE was far less common. Between 3 and 6 months after operation for IE, patients who inject drugs have a hazard of death or reoperation that is about 10 times that of patients who do not inject drugs.

Narrative systematic reviews suggest associations with poorer mental health outcomes, with less strong evidence for behavioural and other physical health outcomes. No reviews were identified for wider socio-economic or developmental outcomes. This systematic overview highlights that there is consistent evidence linking social isolation and loneliness to worse cardiovascular and mental health outcomes. The role of social isolation and loneliness in other conditions and their socio-economic consequences is less clear.

It complements a separate updated statement on depression and CHD.

Evidence regarding a relationship between CHD and job (in)security, job satisfaction, working hours, effort-reward imbalance and job loss is inconclusive. Expert consensus is that workplace programs aimed at weight loss, exercise and other standard cardiovascular risk factors may have positive outcomes for these risk factors, but no evidence is available regarding the effect of such programs on the development of CHD. Social isolation after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with an adverse prognosis. Expert consensus is that although measures to reduce social isolation are likely to produce positive psychosocial effects, it is unclear whether this would also improve CHD outcomes. Acute emotional stress may trigger MI or takotsubo (""stress"") cardiomyopathy, but the absolute increase in transient risk from an individual stressor is low.

One of the postulated mechanisms through which these determinants have been linked to health and illness is their relationship to social support. The health determinant, social isolation or lack of a social support network (SSN), and its effects on premature mortality after acute myocardial infarction mandate further scrutiny by the cardiovascular community for several reasons. First, as a predictor of 1-year mortality, low SSN is equivalent to many of the classic risk factors, such as elevated cholesterol level, tobacco use, and hypertension. Second, treatment of acute myocardial infarction is costly. Because low social support is associated with an increased 1-year mortality, neglecting the role of the SSN may diminish the possible gains accrued during acute-phase treatment. Therefore, lack of an SSN should be considered a risk factor for subsequent morbidity and mortality after a myocardial infarction. Finally, cardiac rehabilitation programs and other extant prevention strategies can be better used to reduce mortality after myocardial infarction.

Methods and Results This study included 44 174 postmenopausal women of diverse race and ethnicity from the WHI (Women's Health Initiative) study who underwent annual assessment for HF adjudication from baseline enrollment (1993-1998) through 2018. We conducted a mediation analysis to examine depressive symptoms as a potential mediator and further examined effect modification by age and race and ethnicity. Incident HF requiring hospitalization was the main outcome. Social isolation was a composite variable based on marital/partner status, religious ties, and community ties. Depressive symptoms were assessed using CES-D (Center for Epidemiology Studies-Depression). Over a median follow-up of 15.0 years, we analyzed data from 36 457 women, and 2364 (6.5%) incident HF cases occurred; 2510 (6.9%) participants were socially isolated. In multivariable analyses adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical, and general health/functioning; socially isolated women had a higher risk of incident HF than nonisolated women (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08-1.41).

Clinical data suggests that SI is an important risk factor for increased mortality and delayed functional recovery following ischemic stroke. Attesting to the importance of mortality and behavioral factors in stroke outcome is that these same effects can be reproduced in animal models of experimental stroke. This has allowed researchers to identify several mechanistic changes that occur with affiliative interactions.

Interactions between social isolation, loneliness, and educational level were also evaluated. Baseline isolation was significantly associated with decreases in all cognitive function measures at follow-up (β=-.05 to -.03, p<.001), independently of baseline scores, whereas loneliness was associated with poorer immediate recall (β=-.05, p<.001) and delayed recall (β=-.03, p=.02). There was a significant interaction between educational level and both isolation (p=.02) and loneliness (p=.01) for delayed recall, such that isolation and loneliness were associated with poorer recall only among those with low levels of education.

The study sample covered 21,597 randomly selected adolescents and adults living in Switzerland and aged 15 and older. A multifactorial five-item social integration index was used to assess social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. Social isolation has been found to steadily increase with age and almost consistently to be strongly associated with poor health conditions and unfavorable behaviors across all ages. Nearly a quarter of the general population could be categorized as either only partly integrated or even poorly integrated and largely isolated. The socially isolated people independent of their age showed strongly elevated relative risks of poor self-rated health (aOR = 4.0), musculoskeletal disorders (aOR = 2.8), moderate to severe depression (aOR = 11.5), and multiple health problems (aOR = 5.0). They were also found to be at comparably high risk of behaving unhealthy with regard to physical inactivity (aOR = 2.2), poor diet (aOR = 1.9) and use of psychotropic medications (aOR = 3.6). Although prevalence rates of poor health conditions and behaviors differed greatly between the studied age groups, strong associations and clear dose-response relationships have been found separately for all age groups and particularly for the youngest.

Of the 10 reviewed studies, 6 identify clique members, liaisons, and isolates as contributing factors to adolescent cigarette smoking. Significantly higher rates of smoking are noted among isolates than clique members or liaisons in terms of peer network structure. Eight of the reviewed studies indicate that peer selection or influence precedes adolescents' smoking behavior and intent to smoke. Such peer selection or influence accounts for a large portion of similarities among smoking adolescents. Adolescents who are identified as isolates are more likely to smoke and engage in risk-taking behaviors than others in the peer network structure.

Weak social connectedness, however, is largely regarded as a second-tier health-risk factor in clinical and research settings. This may be because the mechanisms by which this factor impacts on physical health are poorly understood. Budding research, however, advances the idea that social connectedness buffers against stress-related allostatic load-a known precursor for cardiovascular disease and cancer. The present paper reviews the empirical knowledge on the relationship between everyday stress, social connectedness, and allostatic load. Of 6022 articles retained in the literature search, 20 met predefined inclusion criteria. These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load. Several moderators of this relationship were also identified, including gender, social status, and quality of social ties. More research into these factors, however, is warranted to conclusively determine their significance. The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are, the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load. The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus, at least partially, be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load.

Calcification was present in 351 (44.8%) participants (CAC score range 0-3022; mean 111.5 +/- 307.2). Indicators of social isolation (being single or widowed) were independently associated with elevated risk for the presence of CAC, even after adjustment for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, and low-density lipoprotein (adjusted odds ratios 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-3.10, and 2.48, 95% CI = 1.02-6.03, respectively). By contrast, health behaviors, socioeconomic status, and depressive symptoms were not related to CAC. Social network indices such as being single or widowed are associated with CAC, independent of age and coronary risk factors. Because coronary calcification has been identified as a potential marker of early atherosclerosis, these findings may partially explain the predictive value of limited social networks for future adverse cardiovascular health outcomes.",success

The purpose of this paper is to review the features and consequences of loneliness within a comprehensive theoretical framework that informs interventions to reduce loneliness. We review physical and mental health consequences of loneliness, mechanisms for its effects, and effectiveness of extant interventions. Features of a loneliness regulatory loop are employed to explain cognitive, behavioral, and physiological consequences of loneliness and to discuss interventions to reduce loneliness.

Typically the aim is to identify the total effect of the exposure on the outcome, the effect of the exposure that acts through a given set of mediators of interest (indirect effect) and the effect of the exposure unexplained by those same mediators (direct effect). The traditional approach to mediation analysis is based on adjusting for the mediator in standard regression models to estimate the direct effect. However, several methodological papers have shown that under a number of circumstances this traditional approach may produce flawed conclusions. Through a better understanding of the causal structure of the variables involved in the analysis, with a formal definition of direct and indirect effects in a counterfactual framework, alternative analytical methods have been introduced to improve the validity and interpretation of mediation analysis. In this paper, we review and discuss the impact of the three main sources of potential bias in the traditional approach to mediation analyses: (i) mediator-outcome confounding;(ii) exposure-mediator interaction and (iii) mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure.

There has been little prospective research on the long-term impact of social isolation in childhood on adult health or the pathways which might be involved. The aim of this study was to investigate whether social isolation in childhood is associated with increased adult inflammation and the mechanisms involved across the life course. This study used multiply-imputed data on 7462 participants of the National Child Development Study in Great Britain. The association between child social isolation (7-11 yrs) and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in middle age (44 yrs) was examined. We additionally investigated the role of adult social isolation, psychological distress, health behaviors and socioeconomic factors as potential mediators using path analysis and concurrent measurements made across the life course. Socially isolated children had higher levels of C-reactive protein in mid-life (standardized coefficient=0.05, p≤0.001). In addition, children who were socially isolated tended to have lower subsequent educational attainment, be in a less advantaged social class in adulthood, were more likely to be psychologically distressed across adulthood and were more likely to be obese and to smoke. All of these factors partially explained the association between childhood social isolation and CRP. However, this association remained statistically significant after considering all mediators simultaneously. Social isolation in childhood is associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein in mid-life. This is explained in part through complex mechanisms acting across the life course.

Authors of reviews included in this paper often used the same terms to categorise different intervention components and many did not provide a clear definition of these terms. There were inconsistent meanings attributed to intervention characteristics. Overall, interventions were commonly categorised on the basis of: 1) group or one-to-one delivery mode, 2) the goal of the intervention, and 3) the intervention type. Several authors replicated the categorisation system used in previous reviews. Many interventions have been developed to combat loneliness and social isolation among older people. The individuality of the experience of loneliness and isolation may cause difficulty in the delivery of standardised interventions.

In highly developed societies, the influence of the natural environment is moderated by the physical characteristics of the social environments such as the built environment and pollution, as well as by socioeconomic status and social networks. These attributes of the social environment shape lifestyle choices that significantly modify CVD risk. An understanding of how different domains of the environment, individually and collectively, affect CVD risk could lead to a better appraisal of CVD and aid in the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies to limit the increasingly high global burden of heart disease and stroke.",success

We hypothesized that PH would be a marker of symptomatic pulmonary congestion, distinguishing HFpEF from pre-clinical hypertensive heart disease. This community-based study of 244 HFpEF patients (age 76 +/- 13 years; 45% male) was followed up using Doppler echocardiography over 3 years. Control subjects were 719 adults with HTN without HF (age 66 +/- 10 years; 44% male). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was derived from the tricuspid regurgitation velocity and PH defined as PASP >35 mm Hg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was estimated from the ratio of early transmitral flow velocity to early mitral annular diastolic velocity. In HFpEF, PH was present in 83% and the median (25th, 75th percentile) PASP was 48 (37, 56) mm Hg. PASP increased with PCWP (r = 0.21; p < 0.007). Adjusting for PCWP, PASP was higher in HFpEF than HTN (p < 0.001). The PASP distinguished HFpEF from HTN with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.91 (p < 0.001) and strongly predicted mortality in HFpEF (hazard ratio: 1.3 per 10 mm Hg; p < 0.001). PH is highly prevalent and often severe in HFpEF. Although pulmonary venous HTN contributes to PH, it does not fully account for the severity of PH in HFpEF, suggesting that a component of pulmonary arterial HTN also contributes.

Two standard deviations above this mean value would suggest mPAP >20 mmHg as above the upper limit of normal (above the 97.5th percentile).

We hypothesized that a fluid challenge during right heart catheterization would identify occult pulmonary venous hypertension (OPVH). We reviewed the results of patients undergoing fluid challenge in our pulmonary hypertension database from 2004 to 2011. Baseline hemodynamics were obtained and repeated after infusion of 0.5 L of normal saline for 5 to 10 minutes. Patients were categorized as OPVH if PWP increased to >15 mm Hg after fluid challenge.

After fluid challenge, five of 66 patients with no PH (8%) and eight of 124 with precapillary PH (6%) had the diagnosis reclassified as postcapillary PH. Fluid challenge was associated with an increase in PAWP by 7 ± 2 mm Hg in postcapillary PH and 3 ± 1 mm Hg in both precapillary PH and no-PH groups. Between-group differences were significant, but there was overlap. There were no adverse events related to fluid challenge. Prediction bands calculated from quadratic fits of the PAWP responses in pooled control subjects with no PH and patients with precapillary PH helped confirm 18 mm Hg as the cutoff for diagnosing postcapillary PH. Fluid challenge with 7 mL/kg saline increases PAWP, more in postcapillary than in precapillary PH or in control subjects with no PH.

The prospective cohort had 172 patients with SHF (14% Cpc-PH) and 219 patients with DHF (12% Cpc-PH). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.034) and the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to systolic pulmonary artery pressure ratio (P = 0.015) predicted Cpc-PH in SHF. Younger age (P = 0.004), valvular heart disease (P = 0.046), and the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to systolic pulmonary artery pressure ratio predicted Cpc-PH in DHF (P = 0.016). Right ventricular-pulmonary vascular coupling was worse in Cpc-PH patients (end-systolic elastance to effective arterial elastance [Ees/Ea]: SHF: 1.05 ± 0.25; P = 0.002; DHF: 1.17 ± 0.27; P = 0.027) than in those with isolated post-capillary PH (Ees/Ea: SHF: 1.52 ± 0.51; DHF: 1.45 ± 0.29).

Estimated PASP was obtainable in 57% of subjects at rest, but feasibility decreased to 15-16% during exercise, due mainly to an inability to obtain eRAP during stress. Estimated PASP correlated well with direct PASP at rest (r=0.76, p<0.0001; bias -1 mmHg) and during exercise (r=0.76, p=0.001; bias +3 mmHg).

Estimation of eRAP during exercise from resting eRAP improved discrimination of patients with or without EIPH (area under the curve 0.81), with minimal bias (5 mmHg), but wide limits of agreement (-14-25 mmHg).

We constructed two BMI genetic risk scores from genome-wide association study summary data and deployed them in nonoverlapping cohorts of subjects referred for right heart catheterization (RHC) or echocardiography. A BMI highly polygenic risk score (hpGRS) optimally powered to detect shared genetic architecture of obesity with other traits was tested for association with RHC parameters including markers of pulmonary vascular remodeling. A BMI strict genetic risk score (sGRS) composed of high-confidence genetic variants was used for Mendelian randomization analyses to assess if higher BMI causes higher PAP. Among all subjects, both directly measured BMI and hpGRS were positively associated with pulmonary arterial pressures but not markers of pulmonary vascular remodeling. Categorical analyses revealed BMI and hpGRS were associated with PVH but not PAH. Mendelian randomization of the sGRS supported that higher BMI is causal of higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Sensitivity analyses showed sPAP-BMI sGRS relationship was preserved when either individuals with PAH or PVH were excluded. In the echocardiographic cohort, BMI and hpGRS were positively associated with estimated PAP and markers of left heart remodeling.

PVH in patients with normal LV systolic function, commonly referred to as diastolic dysfunction, is not well characterized. We observed that many patients with PH due to PVH have obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia, which are clinical features of the metabolic syndrome (MS), a previously identified cause for systemic vascular disease.

Although pulmonary hypertension in OSA is traditionally viewed as a result of apneas and intermittent hypoxia during sleep, recent studies indicate that neither of these factors correlates very well with pulmonary artery pressure. Human data show that pulmonary hypertension in the setting of OSA is, in large part, due to left heart dysfunction with either preserved or diminished ejection fraction. Longstanding increased left heart filling pressures eventually lead to pulmonary venous hypertension. The combination of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary venous hypertension with abnormal production of mediators will result in vascular cell proliferation and aberrant vascular remodeling leading to pulmonary hypertension. These changes are in many ways similar to those seen in other forms of pulmonary hypertension and suggest shared mechanisms. The majority of patients with OSA do not receive a diagnosis and are undertreated. Appreciating the high prevalence and understanding the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension in OSA would lead to better recognition and management of the condition.",success

Doppler studies were performed at three levels of inspired oxygen concentration (11%, 21%, and 50%) and during incremental increases in pulmonary blood flow (10, 20, and 30 microg/kg/min dobutamine infusions). Treatment resulted in a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa, 16.8 +/- 1.2 mm Hg before CPAP versus 13.9 +/- 0.6 mm Hg after 4 mo CPAP, p < 0.05) and total pulmonary vascular resistance (231.1 +/- 19.6 versus 186.4 +/- 12.3 dyn. s. cm(-)(5), p < 0.05). The greatest treatment effects occurred in the five patients who were pulmonary hypertensive at baseline. The pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia decreased after CPAP (DeltaPpa/DeltaSa(O(2)) 10.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg before versus 6.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg after 4 mo CPAP, p < 0.05). The curve of Ppa versus cardiac output (Q), derived from the incremental dobutamine infusion, shifted downward in a parallel fashion during treatment. Systemic diastolic blood pressure also fell significantly. Improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics were not attributable to changes in left ventricular diastolic function or Pa (O(2)).

Patients with HFpEF were categorized into stages of AF progression: 181 (65%) had no history of AF, 49 (18%) had paroxysmal AF, and 48 (17%) had permanent AF. Patients with permanent AF were more congested with greater pulmonary vascular disease and lower cardiac output. LA volumes increased, while LA compliance, LA reservoir strain, and right ventricular function decreased with increasing AF burden. The presence of permanent AF was characterized by a distinct pathophysiology, with greater total heart volume caused by atrial dilatation, leading to elevated filling pressures through heightened pericardial restraint. Survival decreased with increasing AF burden. Ten-year progression to permanent AF was common, particularly in paroxysmal AF (52%), and the likelihood of AF progression increased with higher AF stage, poorer LA compliance, and lower LA strain. LA compliance and mechanics progressively decline with increasing AF burden in HFpEF, increasing risk for new onset AF and progressive AF.

Compared with sham conditions, only supracoronary aortic banding+MetS rats developed precapillary PH, as measured by both echocardiography and right/left heart catheterization. PH in supracoronary aortic banding+MetS was associated with macrophage accumulation and increased IL-6 production in lung.

PAs of obese rats produced reactive oxygen species and decreased sGCβ1 expression. Mechanistically, cultured PA smooth muscle cells from obese rats and humans with diabetes or treated with palmitic acid, glucose, and insulin showed increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which enhanced miR-193b-dependent RNA degradation of nuclear factor Y α subunit (NFYA), resulting in decreased sGCβ1-cGMP signaling.

Over a median of 26.2 months, a primary outcome event occurred in 415 of 2997 patients (13.8%) in the empagliflozin group and in 511 of 2991 patients (17.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.90; P<0.001). This effect was mainly related to a lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure in the empagliflozin group. The effects of empagliflozin appeared consistent in patients with or without diabetes. The total number of hospitalizations for heart failure was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (407 with empagliflozin and 541 with placebo; hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88; P<0.001).

Although the ECG has long offered valuable insights into cardiac and non-cardiac health and disease, its interpretation requires considerable human expertise. Advanced AI methods, such as deep-learning convolutional neural networks, have enabled rapid, human-like interpretation of the ECG, while signals and patterns largely unrecognizable to human interpreters can be detected by multilayer AI networks with precision, making the ECG a powerful, non-invasive biomarker. Large sets of digital ECGs linked to rich clinical data have been used to develop AI models for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, silent (previously undocumented and asymptomatic) atrial fibrillation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as the determination of a person's age, sex and race, among other phenotypes. The clinical and population-level implications of AI-based ECG phenotyping continue to emerge, particularly with the rapid rise in the availability of mobile and wearable ECG technologies. In this Review, we summarize the current and future state of the AI-enhanced ECG in the detection of cardiovascular disease in at-risk populations, discuss its implications for clinical decision-making in patients with cardiovascular disease and critically appraise potential limitations and unknowns.",success

We identified 36 186 ECGs from the University of California, San Francisco database that would enable training of models for estimation of cardiac structure or function or detection of disease. We segmented the ECG into standard component waveforms and intervals using a novel combination of convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models and evaluated this segmentation by comparing resulting electrical intervals against 141 864 measurements produced during the clinical workflow. We then built a patient-level ECG profile, a 725-element feature vector and used this profile to train and interpret machine learning models for examples of cardiac structure (left ventricular mass, left atrial volume, and mitral annulus e-prime) and disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and mitral valve prolapse). ECG measurements derived from the convolutional neural network-hidden Markov model segmentation agreed with clinical estimates, with median absolute deviations as a fraction of observed value of 0.6% for heart rate and 4% for QT interval. Models trained using patient-level ECG profiles enabled surprising quantitative estimates of left ventricular mass and mitral annulus e' velocity (median absolute deviation of 16% and 19%, respectively) with good discrimination for left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction as binary traits.

In a prospective trial, subjects with HFpEF (n=39) and controls (n=18) underwent comprehensive invasive and noninvasive hemodynamic assessment using high fidelity micromanometer catheters, echocardiography, and expired gas analysis at rest and during dobutamine infusion. HFpEF subjects displayed similar RV structure but significantly impaired RV systolic (lower RV dP/dtmax/IP and s') and diastolic function (higher RV τ) coupled with more severe pulmonary vascular disease, manifest by higher PA pressures, higher PA resistance, and lower PA compliance compared with controls.

Obesity is associated with both elevated venous pressure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). To explore the mechanisms underlying this association, we evaluated relationships between blood volume distribution, venous compliance, and body mass in patients with and without HFpEF. Subjects with HFpEF (n = 62) and non-cardiac dyspnoea (NCD) (n = 79) underwent invasive haemodynamic exercise testing with echocardiography. SBV was estimated (eSBV) from measured haemodynamic variables fit to a comprehensive cardiovascular model. Compared to NCD, patients with HFpEF displayed a leftward-shifted central venous pressure-dimension relationship, indicating reduced venous compliance. eSBV was 81% higher at rest and 69% higher during exercise in HFpEF than NCD (both P < 0.0001), indicating reduced venous capacitance. Despite greater augmented eSBV with exercise, the increase in cardiac output was reduced in HFpEF, suggesting operation on the plateau of the Starling curve. Exercise eSBV was directly correlated with higher body mass index (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001) and inversely correlated with right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling (r = -0.57, all P < 0.0001). Patients with HFpEF display reductions in systemic venous compliance and increased eSBV related to reduced venous capacitance, abnormalities in right ventricular-pulmonary artery interaction, and increased body fat.

The percentage of children with cardiomyopathy who underwent a heart transplantation has not declined over the past 10 years, and cardiomyopathy remains the leading cause of transplantation for children >1 year of age. Studies from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry have shown that causes are established in very few children with cardiomyopathy, yet genetic causes are likely to be present in most. The incidence of pediatric cardiomyopathy is ≈1 per 100 000 children. This is comparable to the incidence of such childhood cancers as lymphoma, Wilms tumor, and neuroblastoma.

The next target to improve outcomes is optimising treatments to delay the onset or slow the progression of cardiac involvement and so prolong survival further. To assess the effects of interventions for preventing or treating cardiac involvement in DMD, BMD, and XLDCM, using measures of change in cardiac function over six months. On 16 October 2017 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, and on 12 December 2017, we searched two clinical trials registries. We also searched conference proceedings and bibliographies. We considered only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and randomised cross-over trials for inclusion. In the Discussion, we reviewed open studies, longitudinal observational studies and individual case reports but only discussed studies that adequately described the diagnosis, intervention, pretreatment, and post-treatment states and in which follow-up lasted for at least six months. Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts identified from the search and performed data extraction. All three authors assessed risk of bias independently, compared results, and decided which trials met the inclusion criteria. They assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE criteria. We included five studies (N = 205) in the review; four studies included participants with DMD only, and one study included participants with DMD or BMD. All studied different interventions, and meta-analysis was not possible. We found no studies for XLDCM. None of the trials reported cardiac function as improved or stable cardiac versus deteriorated.The randomised first part of a two-part study of perindopril (N = 28) versus placebo (N = 27) in boys with DMD with normal heart function at baseline showed no difference in the number of participants with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) of less than 45% after three years of therapy (n = 1 in each group; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.77). This result is uncertain because of study limitations, indirectness and imprecision. In a non-randomised follow-up study, after 10 years, more participants who had received placebo from the beginning had reduced LVEF% (less than 45%). Adverse event rates were similar between the placebo and treatment groups (low-certainty evidence).A study comparing treatment with lisinopril versus losartan in 23 boys newly diagnosed with Duchenne cardiomyopathy showed that after 12 months, both were equally effective in preserving or improving LVEF% (lisinopril 54.6% (standard deviation (SD) 5.19), losartan 55.2% (SD 7.19); mean difference (MD) -0.60% CI -6.67 to 5.47: N = 16). The certainty of evidence was very low because of very serious imprecision and study limitations (risk of bias). Two participants in the losartan group were withdrawn due to adverse events: one participant developed an allergic reaction, and a second exceeded the safety standard with a fall in ejection fraction greater than 10%. Authors reported no other adverse events related to the medication (N = 22; very low-certainty evidence).A study comparing idebenone versus placebo in 21 boys with DMD showed little or no difference in mean change in cardiac function between the two groups from baseline to 12 months; for fractional shortening the mean change was 1.4% (SD 4.1) in the idebenone group and 1.6% (SD 2.6) in the placebo group (MD -0.20%, 95% CI -3.07 to 2.67, N = 21), and for ejection fraction the mean change was -1.9% (SD 9.8) in the idebenone group and 0.4% (SD 5.5) in the placebo group (MD -2.30%, 95% CI -9.18 to 4.58, N = 21). The certainty of evidence was very low because of study limitations and very serious imprecision. Reported adverse events were similar between the treatment and placebo groups (low-certainty evidence).A multicentre controlled study added eplerenone or placebo to 42 patients with DMD with early cardiomyopathy but preserved left ventricular function already established on ACEI or ARB therapy. Results showed that eplerenone slowed the rate of decline of magnetic resonance (MR)-assessed left ventricular circumferential strain at 12 months (eplerenone group median 1.0%, interquartile range (IQR) 0.3 to -2.2; placebo group median 2.2%, IQR 1.3 to -3.1%; P = 0.020). The median decline in LVEF over the same period was also less in the eplerenone group (-1.8%, IQR -2.9 to 6.0) than in the placebo group (-3.7%, IQR -10.8 to 1.0; P = 0.032). We downgraded the certainty of evidence to very low for study limitations and serious imprecision. Serious adverse events were reported in two patients given placebo but none in the treatment group (very low-certainty evidence).A randomised placebo-controlled study of subcutaneous growth hormone in 16 participants with DMD or BMD showed an increase in left ventricular mass after three months' treatment but no significant improvement in cardiac function. The evidence was of very low certainty due to imprecision, indirectness, and study limitations. There were no clinically significant adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).Some studies were at risk of bias, and all were small. Therefore, although there is some evidence from non-randomised data to support the prophylactic use of perindopril for cardioprotection ahead of detectable cardiomyopathy, and for lisinopril or losartan plus eplerenone once cardiomyopathy is detectable, this must be considered of very low certainty. Findings from non-randomised studies, some of which have been long term, have led to the use of these drugs in daily clinical practice. Based on the available evidence from RCTs, early treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be comparably beneficial for people with a dystrophinopathy; however, the certainty of evidence is very low. Very low-certainty evidence indicates that adding eplerenone might give additional benefit when early cardiomyopathy is detected. No clinically meaningful effect was seen for growth hormone or idebenone, although the certainty of the evidence is also very low.",success

Methods and Results This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial. Subjects were randomized to eplerenone, 50 mg, or spironolactone, 50 mg, orally once daily for 12 months. The primary outcome was change in left ventricular systolic strain at 12 months. Among 52 enrolled male subjects, aged 14 (interquartile range, 12-18) years, spironolactone was noninferior to eplerenone (∆strain, 0.4 [interquartile range, -0.4 to 0.6] versus 0.2 [interquartile range, -0.2 to 0.7]; <i>P</i>=0.542).

Mutations causing loss or premature truncation of dystrophin result in dystrophin protein deficiency, which renders the plasma membrane of skeletal myofibers and cardiomyocytes weakened.

Future approaches entail gene editing to target the single copy of the DMD gene on the X-chromosome.

The corresponding protein, dystrophin, has a relative molecular mass of 400,000. Most mutations causing DMD and BMD are deletions and deletions associated with both phenotypes are observed throughout the gene sequence. This observation led to the suggestion that DMD patients possess deletions that disrupt the reading frame of the protein, whereas BMD patients have deletions that retain the translational reading frame and enable the muscle cells to produce altered dystrophin products. This theory is supported by immunoblotting studies, which show that DMD patients lack dystrophin in their muscle cells or that dystrophin is present at very low levels, whereas BMD patients produce a protein with reduced abundance or abnormal size. Here we describe a deletion of the dystrophin gene in a family segregating for very mild BMD, one member of which was still ambulant at age 61 years, which removes a central part of the dystrophin gene encompassing 5,106 base pairs of coding sequence, almost half the coding information. Immunological analysis of muscle from one of the patients demonstrates that this mutation results in the production of a truncated polypeptide localized correctly in the muscle cell.

The goals of this study were to evaluate the risk of heart failure, temporal changes by treatment periods, and the risk factors for heart failure in childhood cancer survivors ( CCS ). Methods and Results The DCOG-LATER (Dutch Childhood Oncology Group-Long-Term Effects After Childhood Cancer) cohort includes 6,165 5-year CCS diagnosed between 1963 and 2002. Details on prior cancer diagnosis and treatment were collected for this nationwide cohort. Cause-specific cumulative incidences and risk factors of heart failure were obtained. Cardiac follow-up was complete for 5,845 CCS (94.8%). After a median follow-up of 19.8 years and at a median attained age of 27.3 years, 116 survivors developed symptomatic heart failure. The cumulative incidence of developing heart failure 40 years after childhood cancer diagnosis was 4.4% (3.4%-5.5%) among all CCS. The cumulative incidence of heart failure grade ≥3 among survivors treated in the more recent treatment periods was higher compared with survivors treated earlier (Gray test, P=0.05). Mortality due to heart failure decreased in the more recent treatment periods (Gray test, P=0.02). In multivariable analysis, survivors treated with a higher dose of mitoxantrone or cyclophosphamide had a higher risk of heart failure than survivors who were exposed to lower doses. Conclusions CCS treated with mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, anthracyclines, or radiotherapy involving the heart are at a high risk for severe, life-threatening or fatal heart failure at a young age. Although mortality decreased, the incidence of severe or life-threatening heart failure increased with more recent treatment periods.",success

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible cardiac toxicities of CAR-T. The registry included 137 patients who received CAR-T. Covariates included the occurrence and grade of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the administration of tocilizumab for CRS. Cardiac toxicity was defined as a decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction or an increase in serum troponin. Cardiovascular events were a composite of arrhythmias, decompensated heart failure, and CV death. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 54 to 70 years), 67% were male, 88% had lymphoma, and 8% had myeloma. Approximately 50% were treated with commercial CAR-T (Yescarta or Kymriah), and the remainder received noncommercial products. CRS, occurring a median of 5 days (IQR: 2 to 7 days) after CAR-T, occurred in 59%, and 39% were grade ≥2. Tocilizumab was administered to 56 patients (41%) with CRS, at a median of 27 h (IQR: 16 to 48 h) after onset. An elevated troponin occurred in 29 of 53 tested patients (54%), and a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction in 8 of 29 (28%); each occurred only in patients with grade ≥2 CRS. There were 17 CV events (12%, 6 CV deaths, 6 decompensated heart failure, and 5 arrhythmias; median time to event of 21 days), all occurred with grade ≥2 CRS (31% patients with grade ≥2 CRS), and 95% of events occurred after an elevated troponin. The duration between CRS onset and tocilizumab administration was associated with CV events, where the risk increased 1.7-fold with each 12-h delay to tocilizumab. Among adults, cardiac injury and CV events are common post-CAR-T. There was a graded relationship among CRS, elevated troponin, and CV events, and a shorter time from CRS onset to tocilizumab was associated with a lower rate of CV events.",success

Safety evaluation of these drugs has shown evidence of cardiotoxicity of varying frequency and severity between agents; concern has led to updated labeling, warning prescribers of such. This review seeks to clarify the present dangers and investigate cardiotoxic mechanisms of action for each discussed TKI. Dasatinib was connected primarily with an incidence of fluid retention, edema, QT prolongation, and pulmonary hypertension in clinical studies. It is theorized that this is due to a combination of off-target kinase binding and on-target binding of Bcr-Abl, and less likely, mitochondrial induced apoptosis. Studies showed sorafenib to carry the risk of hypertension, QT prolongation, and myocardial infarction. Proposed mechanisms for these side effects include inhibition of proteins, vascular endothelium growth factor receptor, hERG potassium channels, and the RAF/MERK/ERK pro-survival pathway. Finally, lapatinib showed evidence of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and QT prolongation in clinical studies. The literature attributes these as side effects of on-target ErbB2 binding leading to mitochondrial induced apoptosis. The concern warranted by these findings is in question. Pooled safety data suggest that the overall risk for cardiotoxicity is minimal in dasatinib and lapatinib. Sorafenib seems to carry a moderate concern. For the discussed agents, recommendations agree that routine monitoring via methods such as electroencephalogram, cardiac biomarkers, and blood pressure is warranted during the course of treatment, in addition to a comprehensive collection of past medical history and risk factors to identify those at heightened risk for cardiovascular events.",success

Therefore, our study aims to investigate whether empagliflozin may cause direct pleiotropic effects on the myocardium. In order to assess possible direct myocardial effects of empagliflozin, we performed contractility experiments with in toto-isolated human systolic end-stage HF ventricular trabeculae. Empagliflozin significantly reduced diastolic tension, whereas systolic force was not changed. These results were confirmed in murine myocardium from diabetic and non-diabetic mice, suggesting independent effects from diabetic conditions. In human HF cardiomyocytes, empagliflozin did not influence calcium transient amplitude or diastolic calcium level. The mechanisms underlying the improved diastolic function were further elucidated by studying myocardial fibres from patients and rats with diastolic HF (HF with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF). Empagliflozin beneficially reduced myofilament passive stiffness by enhancing phosphorylation levels of myofilament regulatory proteins. Intravenous injection of empagliflozin in anaesthetized HFpEF rats significantly improved diastolic function measured by echocardiography, while systolic contractility was unaffected. Empagliflozin causes direct pleiotropic effects on the myocardium by improving diastolic stiffness and hence diastolic function. These effects were independent of diabetic conditions.

We retrospectively reviewed the mutation spectrum and clinical outcome of all the patients with RASopathy derived from 168 pediatric HCM cases referred to our institution between January 2012 and July 2018. A heterozygous missense mutation in one of known RASopathy genes was identified in 46 unrelated children with HCM. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene were the most prevalent (19/46); this was followed by mutations in RAF1 (11/46), KRAS (5/46), RIT1 (4/46), BRAF (3/46), SOS1 (2/46), HRAS (1/46), and SHOC2 (1/46).

PD can present with cardiac, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system manifestations, as a continuum of phenotypes among two main forms: classical infantile-onset PD (IOPD) and late-onset PD (LOPD). IOPD is caused by severe GAA deficiency and presents at birth with cardiac hypertrophy, muscle hypotonia, and severe respiratory impairment, leading to premature death, if not treated. LOPD is characterized by levels of residual GAA activity up to ∼20% of normal and presents both in children and adults with a varied severity of muscle weakness and motor and respiratory deficit. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), based on repeated intravenous (i.v.) infusions of recombinant human GAA (rhGAA), represents the only available treatment for PD. Upon more than 10 years from its launch, it is becoming evident that ERT can extend the life span of IOPD and stabilize disease progression in LOPD; however, it does not represent a cure for PD. The limited uptake of the enzyme in key affected tissues and the high immunogenicity of rhGAA are some of the hurdles that limit ERT efficacy. GAA gene transfer with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has been shown to reduce glycogen storage and improve the PD phenotype in preclinical studies following different approaches. Here, we present an overview of the different gene therapy approaches for PD, focusing on <i>in vivo</i> gene transfer with AAV vectors and discussing the potential opportunities and challenges in developing safe and effective gene therapies for the disease.

Adult patients (≥18 years) with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (gradient ≥50 mm Hg and New York Heart Association class II-III) were randomly assigned (1:1) to mavacamten or placebo for 30 weeks, followed by an 8-week washout period. Both patients and staff were masked to study treatment. The primary outcome for this secondary analysis was the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), a well validated disease-specific measure of patients' health status. It was administered at baseline and weeks 6, 12, 18, 30 (end of treatment), and 38 (end of study). Changes from baseline to week 30 in KCCQ overall summary (OS) score and all subscales were analysed using mixed model repeated measures. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03470545. Between May 30, 2018, and July 12, 2019, 429 adults were assessed for eligibility, of whom 251 (59%) were enrolled and randomly assigned. Of 123 patients randomly assigned to mavacamten, 92 (75%) completed the KCCQ at baseline and week 30 and of the 128 patients randomly assigned to placebo 88 (69%) completed the KCCQ at baseline and week 30. At 30 weeks, the change in KCCQ-OS score was greater with mavacamten than placebo (mean score 14·9 [SD 15·8] vs 5·4 [13·7]; difference +9·1 [95% CI 5·5-12·8]; p<0·0001), with similar benefits across all KCCQ subscales.

Our objective was to develop and validate a SCD risk prediction model in pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to guide SCD prevention strategies. In an international multicenter observational cohort study, phenotype-positive patients with isolated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <18 years of age at diagnosis were eligible. The primary outcome variable was the time from diagnosis to a composite of SCD events at 5-year follow-up: SCD, resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest, and aborted SCD, that is, appropriate shock following primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Competing risk models with cause-specific hazard regression were used to identify and quantify clinical and genetic factors associated with SCD. The cause-specific regression model was implemented using boosting, and tuned with 10 repeated 4-fold cross-validations. The final model was fitted using all data with the tuned hyperparameter value that maximizes the c-statistic, and its performance was characterized by using the c-statistic for competing risk models. The final model was validated in an independent external cohort (SHaRe [Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry], n=285). Overall, 572 patients met eligibility criteria with 2855 patient-years of follow-up. The 5-year cumulative proportion of SCD events was 9.1% (14 SCD, 25 resuscitated sudden cardiac arrests, and 14 aborted SCD). Risk predictors included age at diagnosis, documented nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, unexplained syncope, septal diameter <i>z</i>-score, left ventricular posterior wall diameter <i>z</i> score, left atrial diameter <i>z</i> score, peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient, and presence of a pathogenic variant. Unlike in adults, left ventricular outflow tract gradient had an inverse association, and family history of SCD had no association with SCD. Clinical and clinical/genetic models were developed to predict 5-year freedom from SCD. Both models adequately discriminated between patients with and without SCD events with a c-statistic of 0.75 and 0.76, respectively, and demonstrated good agreement between predicted and observed events in the primary and validation cohorts (validation c-statistic 0.71 and 0.72, respectively).

This study sought to estimate the incidence of HCM-related SCD and its association with exercise in a large unselected population. Using the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario database encompassing all deaths attended by the coroner, we identified all HCM-related SCDs in individuals 10 to 45 years of age between 2005 and 2016 (70 million person-years). Confirmation of HCM was based on typical macroscopic and microscopic features (definite HCM-related SCD). Sudden deaths with a prior clinical diagnosis of HCM but no autopsy were considered probable HCM-related SCDs. Cases with typical features but no myofiber disarray were considered possible HCM.

To estimate the number of HCM-related aborted cardiac arrests and lives potentially saved by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, all de novo implantations for secondary prevention and all implantations and appropriate shocks for primary prevention in patients with HCM 10 to 45 years of age, respectively, were identified with the use of a registry containing data on implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations from all implanting sites throughout Ontario.

The mechanism of heart failure is not systolic dysfunction, but rather extreme diastolic dysfunction leading to high filling pressures. Risk factors for development of heart failure are a generalized pattern of hypertrophy with a left ventricular posterior wall-to- cavity ratio >0.30, the presence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction at rest, and the co-existence of syndromes in the Noonan/Leopard/Costello spectrum. The 5-year survival of high-risk patients is improved from 54% to 93% by high-dose beta-blocker therapy (>4.5 mg/kg/day propranolol). The mechanism of the beneficial effect of beta-blockers is to improve diastolic function by lengthening of diastole, reducing outflow-obstruction, and inducing a beneficial remodelling resulting in a larger left ventricular cavity, and improved stroke volume. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with increased activity of cardiac sympathetic nerves, and infants in heart failure with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy show signs of extreme sympathetic over-activity, and require exceptionally high doses of beta-blockers to achieve effective beta-blockade as judged by 24 h Holter recordings, often 8-24 mg/kg/day of propranolol or equivalent.

Mean age at operation was 12.9 ± 5.5 years. Preoperatively, mean maximum instantaneous gradient was 89 mm Hg and 95% had significant systolic anterior motion (SAM) with mitral regurgitation (MR). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and permanent pacemaker prior to surgery was present in 21 patients (17%) and 15 (11.7%), respectively. Transaortic extended left ventricular septal myectomy was performed in all patients with no early deaths. Iatrogenic morbidity included new aortic valve regurgitation requiring repair in 7 (5.5%), mitral regurgitation needing repair in 2 (1.5%), ventricular septal defect in 1 (1%), and heart block requiring permanent pacemaker in 1 (1%). An ICD was implanted postoperatively in 8 during the same hospital admission. Mean MIG decreased from 89 to 6 mm Hg (p < 0.0001). Postoperatively, residual chordal SAM was present in 23% with mild or no MR; moderate MR was detected in 1 patient. Four patients (3%) died late during the mean follow-up period of 8.3 years (maximum, 37 years); 1 death was sudden. Overall survival was 98.6%, 94.9%, 92.4%, and 92.4% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively.

Affected individuals are at risk of left or right ventricular failure, or both. Heart failure symptoms can be induced by exercise or be persistent at rest, but many patients are asymptomatic. Patients on chronic treatment for compensated heart failure sometimes present acutely with decompensated heart failure. Other life-threatening risks of left ventricular non-compaction are ventricular arrhythmias or complete atrioventricular block, presenting clinically as syncope, and sudden death. Genetic inheritance arises in at least 30-50% of patients, and several genes that cause left ventricular non-compaction have been identified. These genes seem generally to encode sarcomeric (contractile apparatus) or cytoskeletal proteins, although, in the case of left ventricular non-compaction with congenital heart disease, disturbance of the NOTCH signalling pathway seems part of a final common pathway for this form of the disease. Disrupted mitochondrial function and metabolic abnormalities have a causal role too. Treatments focus on improvement of cardiac efficiency and reduction of mechanical stress in patients with systolic dysfunction. Further, treatment of arrhythmia and implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for prevention of sudden death are mainstays of therapy when deemed necessary and appropriate.

Recommendations were developed and approved by an expert writing group, after a systematic literature search with evidence tables, and discussion of their own clinical experience, to present the current knowledge in the field. Each recommendation is presented using the Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence system formulated by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association and is accompanied by references and explanatory text to provide essential context. The ongoing recognition of the genetic basis of ACM provides the opportunity to examine the diverse triggers and potential common pathway for the development of disease and arrhythmia.",success

All participants underwent targeted DNA sequencing for well-characterized cardiomyopathy-associated genes with comparison to healthy controls (n=1053) sequenced on the same platform. Case ascertainment in England was assessed against national hospital admission data. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Variants that would be considered pathogenic if found in a patient with DCM or ACM were identified in 8% of myocarditis cases compared with <1% of healthy controls (<i>P</i>=0.0097). In the London cohort (n=230; median age, 33 years; 84% men), patients were representative of national myocarditis admissions (median age, 32 years; 71% men; 66% case ascertainment), and there was enrichment of rare truncating variants (tv) in ACM-associated genes (3.1% of cases versus 0.4% of controls; odds ratio, 8.2; <i>P</i>=0.001). This was driven predominantly by <i>DSP</i>-tv in patients with normal LV ejection fraction and ventricular arrhythmia. In Maastricht (n=106; median age, 54 years; 61% men), there was enrichment of rare truncating variants in DCM-associated genes, particularly <i>TTN</i>-tv, found in 7% (all with left ventricular ejection fraction <50%) compared with 1% in controls (odds ratio, 3.6; <i>P</i>=0.0116). Across both cohorts over a median of 5.0 years (interquartile range, 3.9-7.8 years), all-cause mortality was 5.4%.

Pulmonary artery banding (PAB) has been proposed in patients with corrected transposition of the great arteries to retrain the sub-pulmonic left ventricle (LV) and to improve a failing sub-aortic right ventricle. We evaluated the short-term and medium-term effects of PAB in young patients with LVDCM. A retrospective single-center observational study was performed to evaluate the possible benefits of a dilatable surgical PAB in infants and young children with LVDCM. Reported are 12 patients (10 infants, 2 toddlers) with LVDCM referred for heart transplant who received a surgical PAB. There were no hospital deaths. Clinical functional status improved in all patients. The pressure gradient across the PAB increased within 20 days from 28 ± 7 to 43 ± 15 mm Hg. The LV ejection fraction increased from 14.5% ± 5% pre-PAB to 27% ± 13% at hospital discharge and to 47% ± 10% at 3 to 6 months.

Current therapies only delay progression of the cardiac disease or replace the diseased heart with cardiac transplantation. Stem cells represent a recently discovered novel approach to the treatment of cardiac failure that may facilitate the replacement of diseased cardiac tissue and subsequently lead to improved cardiac function and cardiac regeneration. A stem cell is defined as a cell with the properties of being clonogenic, self-renewing, and multipotent. In response to intercellular signalling or environmental stimuli, stem cells differentiate into cells derived from any of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, a powerful advantage for regenerative therapies. Meanwhile, a cardiac progenitor cell is a multipotent cell that can differentiate into cells of any of the cardiac lineages, including endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. Stem cells can be classified into three categories: (1) adult stem cells, (2) embryonic stem cells, and (3) induced pluripotential cells. Adult stem cells have been identified in numerous organs and tissues in adults, including bone-marrow, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and, as was recently discovered, the heart. Embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst stage of the developing embryo. Finally through transcriptional reprogramming, somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, can be converted into induced pluripotential cells that resemble embryonic stem cells. Four classes of stem cells that may lead to cardiac regeneration are: (1) Embryonic stem cells, (2) Bone Marrow derived stem cells, (3) Skeletal myoblasts, and (4) Cardiac stem cells and cardiac progenitor cells. Embryonic stem cells are problematic because of several reasons: (1) the formation of teratomas, (2) potential immunologic cellular rejection, (3) low efficiency of their differentiation into cardiomyocytes, typically 1% in culture, and (4) ethical and political issues. As of now, bone marrow derived stem cells have not been proven to differentiate reproducibly and reliably into cardiomyocytes.

In both groups, CD34(+) cells were mobilized by filgrastim, collected via apheresis, and labeled with technetium-99m radioisotope for single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging. In the intracoronary group, cells were injected intracoronarily in the artery supplying segments of greater perfusion defect on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. In the transendocardial group, electroanatomic mapping was used to identify viable but dysfunctional myocardium, and transendocardial cell injections were performed. Nuclear single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging for quantification of myocardial retention was performed 18 hours thereafter. At baseline, groups did not differ in age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels. The number of CD34(+) cells was also comparable (105 ± 31 × 10(6) in the transendocardial group versus 103 ± 27 × 10(6) in the intracoronary group, P=0.62).

Most pediatric diseases are rare; thus, few practices or centers care for sufficient numbers of children, particularly in subspecialties, to achieve large and representative sample sizes, and substantial between-site variation in care and outcomes persists. Pediatric collaborative improvement networks are multi-site clinical networks that allow practice-based teams to learn from one another, test changes to improve quality, and use their collective experience and data to understand, implement, and spread what works in practice. The model was initially developed in 2002 by an American Board of Pediatrics Workgroup to accelerate the translation of evidence into practice, improve care and outcomes for children, and to serve as the gold standard for the performance in practice component of Maintenance of Certification requirements. Many features of an improvement network derive from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's collaborative improvement model Breakthrough Series, including focus on a high-impact condition or topic; providing support from clinical content and quality improvement experts; using the Model for Improvement to set aims, use data for feedback, and test changes iteratively; providing infrastructure support for data collection, analysis and reporting, and quality improvement coaching; activities to enhance collaboration; and participation of multidisciplinary teams from multiple sites. In addition, they typically include a population registry of the children receiving care for the improvement topic of interest. These registries provide large and representative study samples with high-quality data that can be used to generate information and evidence, as well as to inform clinical decision making. In addition to quality improvement, networks serve as large-scale health system laboratories, providing the social, scientific, and technical infrastructure and data for multiple types of research. Statewide, regional, and national pediatric collaborative networks have demonstrated improvements in primary care practice as well as care for chronic pediatric diseases (eg, asthma, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, congenital heart disease), perinatal care, and patient safety (eg, central line-associated blood stream infections, adverse medication events, surgical site infections); many have documented improved outcomes. Challenges to spreading the improvement network model exist, including the need for the identification of stable funding sources.

Typically, clinicians use empiricalor experiential-based rationales for selecting the dose to use in children, generally in a manner that attempts to achieve the same dose-exposure or pharmacokinetic profile in children as in adults. However, whether this approach achieves the necessary dose exposure or exposure effect needed may not be systematically explored during off-label use. This creates the opportunity for under- or over-exposure in children, particularly in very young children (i.e., less than 2 years old) where a combination of factors during development can effect both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The ethical, physiological and statistical differences of studying new therapeutic agents in children present economic challenges that may create unintended incentives - both positive and negative - for any individual developer who tries to meet the requirements of new legislation to study pharmaceutical agents in children. There should be a continued emphasis in academic clinical pharmacology programs towards creative methods and approaches to better understand these differences in children compared with adults.

A total of 681 patients were enrolled from November 20, 2018, to August 9, 2019, at which time the data and safety monitoring board recommended that patients be assigned only to the MAb114 and REGN-EB3 groups for the remainder of the trial; the recommendation was based on the results of an interim analysis that showed superiority of these groups to ZMapp and remdesivir with respect to mortality. At 28 days, death had occurred in 61 of 174 patients (35.1%) in the MAb114 group, as compared with 84 of 169 (49.7%) in the ZMapp group (P = 0.007), and in 52 of 155 (33.5%) in the REGN-EB3 group, as compared with 79 of 154 (51.3%) in the ZMapp subgroup (P = 0.002). A shorter duration of symptoms before admission and lower baseline values for viral load and for serum creatinine and aminotransferase levels each correlated with improved survival. Four serious adverse events were judged to be potentially related to the trial drugs. Both MAb114 and REGN-EB3 were superior to ZMapp in reducing mortality from EVD.

As COVID-19 was spreading in Europe, the French national institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) established a transdisciplinary team to develop a multi-arm randomised controlled trial named DisCoVeRy. The objective of the trial is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of different investigational re-purposed therapeutics relative to Standard of Care (SoC) in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. DisCoVeRy is a phase III, open-label, adaptive, controlled, multicentre clinical trial in which hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in need of oxygen therapy are randomised between five arms: (1) a control group managed with SoC and four therapeutic arms with re-purposed antiviral agents: (2) remdesivir + SoC, (3) lopinavir/ritonavir + SoC, (4) lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon (IFN)-β-1a + SoC and (5) hydroxychloroquine + SoC. The primary endpoint is the clinical status at Day 15 on the 7-point ordinal scale of the WHO Master Protocol (V.3.0, 3 March 2020). This trial involves patients hospitalised in conventional departments or intensive care units both from academic or non-academic hospitals throughout Europe. A sample size of 3100 patients (620 patients per arm) is targeted. This trial has begun on 22 March 2020. Since 5 April 2020, DisCoVeRy has been an add-on trial of the Solidarity consortium of trials conducted by the WHO in Europe and worldwide. On 8 June 2020, 754 patients have been included.

A systematic review of papers published between January 2001 and May 2013 that examined outcomes or experiences of transfer and transition among young people with congenital heart disease was conducted. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers with the outcomes data combined using narrative synthesis and the experiences data integrated using thematic synthesis. Thirteen papers were included in the review: six reported outcomes following transfer, six reported experiences of transfer and transition, and one reported both outcomes and experiences. The review data indicate that high proportions of young people were lost to follow-up or experienced long gaps in care after leaving pediatric cardiology. Factors that protected against loss to follow-up or lapse in care included: beliefs that specialized adult care was necessary; poorer health status; attendance at pediatric appointments without parents; and pediatric referral to an adult congenital heart disease center. Data on experiences highlighted that many young people were unconcerned about transition, but lacked knowledge about their condition and were insufficiently prepared for transfer. In terms of adult services, many young people desired continuity in the quality of care, youth-oriented facilities, a personalized approach, and for their parents to remain involved in their care, but in a secondary, supportive capacity. In conclusion, the high proportions of young people lost to follow-up highlight the need for formal transition programs, which ensure a planned and coordinated transfer. Patients with congenital heart disease need education throughout adolescence about the implications of their condition, the differences between pediatric and adult services, and self-care management.",success

Comorbidities, pregnancy, and patient/family request to leave pediatric cardiology were identified as initiators for transfer. Complexity of the heart defect was relatively less important when deciding whether to transfer patients. Only one-third of the centers that transfer their patients provide a structured preparation for patients and family. Development of a formal transition program is planned at 59% of the centers that transfer patients.

The numbers of adults with congenital heart defects (CHDs) are increasing rapidly. Current guidelines recommend that just over half of adult CHD patients should be seen every 12 to 24 months by a cardiologist with specific CHD expertise at a regional CHD center, because they are at risk for serious complications (eg, reoperation and/or arrhythmias) and premature mortality. The present study aimed to determine the percent of young adults with CHDs who successfully transferred from pediatric to adult care and examine correlates of successful transfer. Cross-sectional study with prevalence data from an entire cohort. All patients (n = 360) aged 19 to 21 years with complex CHDs who, according to current practice guidelines, should be seen annually at a specialized adult CHD center were identified from the database of the cardiology program at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, a pediatric tertiary care center. Of these patients, 234 completed measures about health beliefs, health behaviors, and medical care since age 18 years. All 15 specialized adult CHD centers in Canada formed the Canadian Adult Congenital Heart (CACH) Network. Attendance for at least 1 follow-up appointment at a CACH center before the age of 22 years was ascertained for all eligible patients. Attendance at a CACH center provides a clear criterion for successful transfer. In the total cohort, 47% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 42-52) had transferred successfully to adult care. There was no difference in rates of successful transfer between patients consenting to complete questionnaires (48%) and those who declined (47%). More than one quarter (27%) of the patients reported having had no cardiac appointments since 18 years. In multivariate analyses of the entire cohort, successful transfer was significantly associated with more pediatric cardiovascular surgeries (odds ratio [OR]: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.40-4.37), older age at last visit to the Hospital for Sick Children (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.10-1.51), and documented recommendations in the medical chart for follow-up at a CACH center. In multivariate analyses of the patients completing questionnaires, successful transfer was significantly related to documented recommendations and patient beliefs that adult CHD care should be at a CACH center (OR: 3.64; 95% CI: 1.34-9.90). Comorbid conditions (OR: 3.13; 95% CI: 1.13-8.67), not using substances (eg, binge drinking; OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.07-0.50), using dental antibiotic prophylaxis (OR: 4.23; 95% CI: 1.48-12.06), and attending cardiac appointments without parents or siblings (OR: 6.59; 95% CI: 1.61-27.00) also correlated with successful transfer. This is the first study to document the percent of young adults with a chronic illness who successfully transfer to adult care in a timely manner. Patients were from an entire birth cohort from the largest pediatric cardiac center in Canada, and outcome data were obtained on all eligible patients. Similar data should be obtained for other chronic illnesses. There is need for considerable improvement in the numbers of young adults with CHDs who successfully transfer to adult care. At-risk adolescents with CHDs should begin the transition process before their teens, should be educated in the importance of antibiotic prophylaxis, should be contacted if a follow-up appointment is missed, and should be directed to a specific CHD cardiologist or program, with the planned timing being stated explicitly. Adult care needs to be discussed in the pediatric setting, and patients must acquire appropriate beliefs about adult care well before transfer. Developmentally appropriate, staged discussions involving the patient, with and without parents, throughout adolescence may help patients acquire these beliefs and an understanding of the need for ongoing care. Improved continuity of pediatric care and provision of clear details for adult follow-up might be sufficient to cause substantive improvements in successful transfer. An understanding of why patients drop out of pediatric care may be needed to improve the continuity of care throughout adolescence. Almost one quarter of the patients believed adult care should be somewhere other than at a CACH center despite opposite recommendations. For these patients, a single discussion of adult care during the final pediatric visit may be too little, too late. In addition to earlier discussions, multiple mechanisms such as referral letters and transition clinics are needed. Similarly, patients engaging in multiple risky or poor health behaviors such as substance use may need more intensive programs to make substantial changes in these behaviors, which hopefully would lead to successful transfer. Overall, these data support the view that transition to adult care (a planned process of discussing and preparing for transfer to an adult health center) is important and should begin well before patients are transferred. The future health of adults with chronic conditions may depend on our ability to make these changes.",success

Transition readiness was higher among patients who were older, more knowledgeable about their condition, had a history of primary cardiac repair and greater self-efficacy, and was lower for boys and patients on cardiac medications. Transition readiness was unrelated to CHD diagnosis and patients' illness uncertainty. Patients' self-advocacy skills were superior to their chronic disease self-management skills. Increased parental medical condition knowledge was positively correlated with patient knowledge, and patient-parent discussion of transfer was associated with increased patient's self-management skills. Transition is not uniformly discussed with young adolescent CHD patients. Parental involvement is correlated with increased transition readiness and patient disease self-management skills.

We measured aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and brachial PWV to evaluate the stiffness gradient [(brachial PWV/aortic PWV)(0.5)] and ascending aortic and aortic bifurcation diameters to assess aortic taper (ascending aortic diameter/aortic bifurcation diameter). The global reflection coefficient was estimated from characteristic impedance and vascular resistance. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine mortality risk. The age-associated increase in aortic PWV was higher in patients (P<0.001). In controls, aortic ascending and bifurcation diameters increased with age, with an unchanged aortic taper. In patients on hemodialysis, age did not associate with increased ascending aortic diameter but did associate with increased aortic bifurcation diameter and decreased aortic taper, both of which also associated with abdominal aortic calcifications and smaller global reflection coefficient (P<0.001). In patients, multivariate models revealed all-cause and cardiovascular mortality associated with age, aortic PWV, and aortic bifurcation diameter with high specificity and sensitivity.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) avidly reacts with nitric oxide (NO) producing cytotoxic reactive nitrogen species capable of nitrating proteins and damaging other molecules. This study tested the hypothesis that CRF results in enhanced ROS-mediated NO inactivation and protein nitration which can be ameliorated with antioxidant therapy. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to CRF (5/6 nephrectomy) and sham-operated controls and fed either a regular diet (vitamin E, 40 U/Kg food) or an antioxidant-fortified diet (vitamin E, 5000 U/Kg food) for 6 weeks. Blood pressure, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), tissue NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, tissue nitrotyrosine (the footprint of NO interaction with ROS), and vascular tissue NO production were determined. CRF resulted in marked elevations of blood pressure, plasma MDA, and tissue nitrotyrosine abundance, but did not change plasma L-arginine level. This was coupled with depressed vascular tissue NO production and reduced immunodetectable NOS proteins in the vascular, renal, and cardiac tissues. Antioxidant therapy ameliorated the CRF-induced hypertension, improved vascular tissue NO production, lowered tissue nitrotyrosine burden, and reversed downregulations of NOS isoforms. In contrast, antioxidant therapy had no effects in the controls. CRF is associated with oxidative stress which promotes NO inactivation by ROS leading to functional NO deficiency, hypertension, and widespread accumulation of protein nitration products. Amelioration of oxidative stress by high-dose vitamin E enhances NO availability, improves hypertension, lowers protein nitration products, and increases NOS expression and vascular NO production in CRF animals.",success

CRF is frequently complicated by hypertension and changes in both the heart (left ventricular hypertrophy) and the vasculature (endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis). The mechanisms underlying changes in vascular function and specifically endothelial dysfunction are unclear. This present study therefore examined subcutaneous resistance artery function in vitro, comparing adult uremic patients and controls using wire myography. Subcutaneous fat biopsies were obtained from 12 patients with CRF (median serum creatinine 735 micromol/L) at the time of renal transplantation or peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion, and from eight controls without renal disease at the time of abdominal surgery. Resistance arteries were mounted on a wire myograph. Their contractile ability was tested with high potassium depolarization, and endothelial integrity was tested by relaxation to acetylcholine. Cumulative concentration-response curves were then constructed for norepinephrine, endothelin-1, acetylcholine, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Following preconstriction with norepinephrine, vessels from uremic patients vasodilated less well to acetylcholine compared with vessels from controls [maximum % relaxation 77% (range 41, 97) vs. 98% (78, 100), P < 0.001]. The vasodilation to SNP was similar [95% (63, 100) vs. 94% (71, 100), P = 0.751]. There was a trend toward increased maximum pressure (kPa) achieved with both norepinephrine and endothelin-1 in vessels from uremic patients, and the contractions to both of these agents were more prolonged in the uremic vessels. The pattern of normal vasodilation to SNP but reduced vasodilation to acetylcholine is consistent with endothelial dysfunction due to impaired nitric oxide (NO) production in uremic vessels. Similar results have been demonstrated in vivo in uremia, one suggested mechanism being accumulation of endogenous inhibitors of NO synthase such as asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). This in vitro study suggests that a short-lived circulating factor is not entirely responsible and that there may be an inherent abnormality in endothelial function in uremia, although the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. Endothelial dysfunction may predispose the patient to accelerated atherosclerosis and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in end-stage renal failure.",success

In normotensive patients this was accompanied by an increase in MAP (delta 6 mm Hg) within the normal range and a significant fall of the regional blood flow. These hemodynamic changes are caused by increases of the regional and presumably also of the total peripheral vascular resistance. Most likely the increase in total peripheral vascular resistance represents an autoregulatory event triggered by the rising tissue oxygenation.

Then, 30 patients underwent polysomnography and we measured Apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), which was calculated as the number of apnoeas plus hypopnoeas per hour of sleep. Clinical characteristics were examined in all patients. Forty-one (34.5%) of the 119 patients had SA. Twenty-seven (22.7%) of the 119 patients had SA with subjective symptoms such as daytime somnolence and snoring. There was a significant difference between body mass index (BMI) in patients with SA and that in patients without SA (22.5 vs 19.8 kg/m2, P<0.001). There were significantly higher prevalences of hypertension (85.4 vs 66.7%, P<0.05) and diabetes mellitus (36.6 vs 10.3%, P<0.01) in patients with SA than those in patients without SA. Multivariable analysis showed that BMI was independently associated with the occurrence of SA (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.38). Mean AHI of 30 patients who underwent polysomnography was 53.2+/-28.9 [central apnoea, 4.1+/-5.6 (8%); obstructive apnoea, 21.7+/-21.5 (42%); mixed apnoea, 4.9+/-8.0 (9%); hypopnoea, 21.4+/-15.5 (41%)].

Seventeen patients with hemodialysis and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea were included. Polysomnographies were performed the night before and after hemodialysis to assess obstructive sleep apnea, and bioimpedance was used to measure fluid overload and leg fluid volume.

In light of recent investigations suggesting that intradialytic hypertension is associated with adverse outcomes, this review broadly covers the epidemiologic characteristics, prognostic significance, potential pathogenic mechanisms, prevention, and possible treatment of intradialytic hypertension. Intradialytic hypertension affects up to 15% of hemodialysis patients and occurs more frequently in patients who are older, have lower dry weights, are prescribed more antihypertensive medications, and have lower serum creatinine levels. Recent studies associated intradialytic hypertension independently with higher hospitalization rates and decreased survival. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms of intradialytic hypertension are uncertain, it likely is multifactorial and includes subclinical volume overload, sympathetic overactivity, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, endothelial cell dysfunction, and specific dialytic techniques. Prevention and treatment of intradialytic hypertension may include careful attention to dry weight, avoidance of dialyzable antihypertensive medications, limiting the use of high-calcium dialysate, achieving adequate sodium solute removal during hemodialysis, and using medications that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or decrease endothelin 1 levels.

30045925,False,Comparative Study;Journal Article;Observational Study,,,,,,,,True,"Evidence on the utility of ambulatory BP monitoring for risk prediction has been scarce and inconclusive in patients on hemodialysis. In addition, in cardiac diseases such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation (common among patients on hemodialysis), studies have found that parameters such as systolic BP (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) have inverse or nonlinear (U-shaped) associations with mortality. In total, 344 patients on hemodialysis (105 with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or both) underwent ambulatory BP monitoring for 24 hours, starting before a dialysis session. The primary end point was all-cause mortality; the prespecified secondary end point was cardiovascular mortality. We performed linear and nonlinear Cox regression analyses for risk prediction to determine the associations between BP and study end points. During the mean 37.6-month follow-up, 115 patients died (47 from a cardiovascular cause). SBP and PP showed a U-shaped association with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the cohort. In linear subgroup analysis, SBP and PP were independent risk predictors and showed a significant inverse relationship to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation or heart failure. In patients without these conditions, these associations were in the opposite direction. SBP and PP were significant independent risk predictors for cardiovascular mortality; PP was a significant independent risk predictor for all-cause mortality. This study provides evidence for the U-shaped association between peripheral ambulatory SBP or PP and mortality in patients on hemodialysis. Furthermore, it suggests that underlying cardiac disease can explain the opposite direction of associations.",success
25376764,False,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,,,,,,True,"Patients undergoing hemodialysis have an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality compared with the general population. Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is estimated to occur during 20%-30% of hemodialysis sessions. To date, no large studies have examined whether IDH is associated with cardiovascular outcomes. This study determined the prevalence of IDH according to interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) and studied the association between IDH and outcomes for cardiovascular events and mortality to better understand its role. This study retrospectively examined records of 39,497 hemodialysis patients during 2007 and 2008. US Renal Data System claims and dialysis provider data were used to determine outcomes. IDH was defined by current Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines (≥20 mmHg fall in systolic BP from predialysis to nadir intradialytic levels plus ≥2 responsive measures [dialysis stopped, saline administered, etc.]). IDWG was measured absolutely (in kilograms) and relatively (in percentages). IDH occurred in 31.1% of patients during the 90-day exposure assessment period. At baseline, the higher the IDWG (relative or absolute), the greater the frequency of IDH (P<0.001). For all-cause mortality, the median follow-up was 398 days (interquartile range, 231-602 days). Compared with patients without IDH, IDH was associated with all-cause mortality (7646 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07 [95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.14]), myocardial infarction (2396 events; 1.20 [1.10 to 1.31]), hospitalization for heart failure/volume overload (8896 events; 1.13 [1.08 to 1.18]), composite hospitalization for heart failure/volume overload or cardiovascular mortality (10,805 events; 1.12 [1.08 to 1.17]), major adverse cardiac events (MACEs; myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality) (4994 events, 1.10 [1.03 to 1.17]), and MACEs+ (MACEs plus arrhythmia or hospitalization for heart failure/volume overload) (12,221 events; 1.14 [1.09 to 1.19]). IDH was potently associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Clinical trials to ascertain causality are needed and should consider reduction in IDWG as a potential means to reduce IDH.",success

Recent investigations in the general population have demonstrated the predictive utility of pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic blood pressure), a measure reflecting the pulsatile nature of the cardiac cycle. To estimate the relationship between pulse pressure and mortality in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and to test our hypothesis that an increasing pulse pressure would be associated with increased risk of death up to 1 year despite the inverse relationship between conventional blood pressure measures and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. Retrospective cohort investigation of patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis at 782 hemodialysis facilities throughout the United States. Of 44 069 eligible patients as of January 1, 1998, 37 069 with complete demographic data were included in the analyses of clinical and laboratory data collected from October 1 through December 31, 1997. Patients were followed up through December 31, 1998. The primary study outcome was death at 1 year. A secondary outcome was the magnitude of the pulse pressure. The final patient cohort was similar to national averages with respect to age, sex, race, and diabetic status. Mean (SD) pulse pressures before dialysis were 75.0 (15.0) mm Hg and 66.9 (13.9) mm Hg after dialysis. By the end of the 1-year follow-up, 5731 patients (18.4%) died. After adjusting for level of systolic blood pressure, multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling showed a direct and consistent relationship between increasing pulse pressure and increasing death risk. Each incremental elevation of 10 mm Hg in postdialysis pulse pressure was associated with a 12% increase in the hazard for death (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.18). Postdialysis systolic blood pressure was inversely related to mortality with a 13% decreased hazard for death for each incremental elevation of 10 mm Hg (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.90). In a multivariable linear regression model, important variables directly associated with elevated pulse pressure included age, diabetes, white race, female sex, and number of years receiving dialysis (all P<.001). Pulse pressure is associated with risk of death in a large, nationally representative sample of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. The recognition of pulse pressure as an important correlate of mortality in patients receiving dialysis highlights the need to investigate the relationship between potential therapeutic implications of conduit vessel function and clinical outcomes in patients with end-stage renal disease.",success
12371980,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"The long-term prognostic associations of pre- and post-dialysis blood pressures, interdialytic weight gain, and antihypertensive use in hemodialysis patients are unclear. The United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Waves 3 and 4 Study, a randomly generated sample of 11,142 subjects receiving hemodialysis on December 31, 1993, was examined, with vital status followed until May 2000. Pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure values, interdialytic weight gain and number of antihypertensives averaged 151.8/79.7, 137.0/74, 3.6% and 0.76, respectively. Prognostic discrimination was maximized by considering pre- and post-systolic and diastolic blood pressure values simultaneously, in a pattern suggesting that wide pulse pressures were associated with mortality (P < 0.0001). Comorbidity adjustment markedly affected associations, with low pre-dialysis diastolic (P < 0.05), low post-dialysis dialysis diastolic pressure (P < 0.05), high post-dialysis dialysis systolic pressure (P < 0.05), and high interdialytic weight gains (P = 0.005) associated with mortality. Each class of antihypertensive drug, except angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, was associated with lower mortality in unadjusted models, an effect most pronounced for beta-blockers (hazards ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.79, P < 0.0001). Comorbidity adjustment eliminated survival associations for each antihypertensive class except beta-blockers. Pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure values have independent associations with mortality, in a way that implicates wide pulse pressures. Much of the adverse prognosis of wide pulse pressures probably reflects older age and cardiovascular comorbidity. Large interdialytic weight gains are associated with shorter survival when comorbidity is taken into account. Beta-blocker use shows a robust association with survival, and may be protective.",success

Intradialytic BPs are not optimal tools for hypertension diagnosis and cardiovascular risk stratification, but they do have critical clinical and prognostic significance. We present evidence associating intradialytic BP phenomena including fall, rise and variability with adverse clinical outcomes and review related pathophysiologic mechanisms and potential management strategies. Observational studies demonstrate associations between intradialytic hypotension, hypertension and BP variability and mortality. Lack of consensus regarding diagnostic criteria has hampered data synthesis, and prospective studies investigating optimal management strategies for BP phenomena are lacking. Mechanistic data suggest that cardiac, gut, kidney and brain ischemia may lie on the causal pathway between intradialytic hypotension and mortality, and endothelial cell dysfunction, among other factors, may be an important mediator of intradialytic hypertension and adverse outcomes. These plausible pathophysiologic links present potential therapeutic targets for future inquiry. The phenomenon of intradialytic BP variability has not been adequately studied, and practical clinical measures and treatment strategies are lacking. Intradialytic BP phenomena have important prognostic bearing. Clinical practice guidelines for both intradialytic hypotension and hypertension exist, but their underlying evidence is weak overall. Further research is needed to develop consensus diagnostic criteria for intradialytic hypotension, hypertension and BP variability and to elucidate optimal treatment and prevention strategies for each BP manifestation.",success

These studies have largely relied on dialysis-unit SBP measures and have not evaluated whether this U-shape also exists in advanced chronic kidney disease, before starting hemodialysis. We determined the association between SBP and mortality at advanced chronic kidney disease and again after initiation of hemodialysis. This was a prospective study of Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants with advanced chronic kidney disease followed through initiation of hemodialysis. We studied the association between SBP and mortality when participants (1) had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=1705), (2) initiated hemodialysis and had dialysis-unit SBP measures (n=403), and (3) initiated hemodialysis and had out-of-dialysis-unit SBP measured at a Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study visit (n=326). Cox models were adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and dialysis parameters. A quadratic term for SBP was included to test for a U-shaped association. At advanced chronic kidney disease, there was no association between SBP and mortality (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.07] per every 10 mm Hg increase). Among participants who started hemodialysis, a U-shaped association between dialysis-unit SBP and mortality was observed. In contrast, there was a linear association between out-of-dialysis-unit SBP and mortality (hazard ratio, 1.26 [95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.40] per every 10 mm Hg increase). In conclusion, more efforts should be made to obtain out-of-dialysis-unit SBP, which may merit more consideration as a target for clinical management and in interventional trials.",success

Here, we explored the relationship between SBP with cardiovascular events, which has important treatment implications but has not been well elucidated. Among 383 hemodialysis participants enrolled in the prospective CRIC study (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort), multivariable splines and Cox models were used to study the association between SBP and adjudicated cardiovascular events (heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease), controlling for differences in demographics, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and dialysis parameters. Dialysis-unit-SBP and out-of-dialysis-unit-SBP were modestly correlated (<i>r</i>=0.34; <i>P</i><0.001). We noted a U-shaped association of dialysis-unit-SBP and risk of cardiovascular events, with the nadir risk between 140 and 170 mm Hg. In contrast, there was a linear stepwise association between out-of-dialysis-unit-SBP with risk of cardiovascular events. Participants with out-of-dialysis-unit-SBP ≥128 mm Hg (top 2 quartiles) had >2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with those with out-of-dialysis-unit-SBP ≤112 mm Hg (3rd SBP quartile: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.08 [95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.87] and fourth SBP quartile: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.76 [95% confidence interval, 1.42-5.33]). In conclusion, among hemodialysis patients, although there is a U-shaped (paradoxical) association of dialysis-unit-SBP and risk of cardiovascular disease, there is a linear association of out-of-dialysis-unit-SBP with risk of cardiovascular disease. Out-of-dialysis-unit blood pressure provides key information and may be an important therapeutic target.",success
