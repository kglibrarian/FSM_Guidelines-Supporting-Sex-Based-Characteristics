We retrospectively reviewed records of OSA children who had undergone AT and a repeated sleep polysomnography after AT from 2001 to 2008. Forty-four children were identified and included in the analysis. The mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) dropped from 14.14+/-15.9 to 3.3+/-7.1. (p<0.001). Twenty (45%) were cured of OSA. After AT, the diastolic BP load decreased significantly. Six out of eight (75%) hypertensive children became normotensive after surgery. For the pre-AT hypertensive group, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly during sleep after AT. However, eight children who were normotensive before AT became hypertensive after AT. These 10 post-AT hypertensive patients were more likely to have post-AT AHI>1 than the post-AT normotensive group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. In the current cohort of OSA children, 44% were cured of OSA and a significant decrease in overall diastolic blood pressure load in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was achieved after adenotonsillectomy for children with OSA. But hypertension may persist or even occur in those previously normotensive children despite the improvement in AHI. Persistence of OSA may be a risk factor and further study is required. Cure of OSA should not be assumed after AT and follow-up PSG should be performed together with 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

Unlike adults, most cases of paediatric SDB are due to the presence of enlarged tonsils and adenoids, thus the main treatment option is adenotonsillectomy (T&A). It is well known that obstructive sleep apnoea in adults increases the risk for hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke, and there is now mounting evidence that SDB also has a significant impact on the cardiovascular system in children with reports of elevated blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction and altered autonomic cardiovascular control. As there is now substantial evidence that elevated blood pressure in childhood is carried on to adulthood it is important to know if treatment of SDB improves cardiovascular outcomes. Studies in adults have shown that treatment of SDB leads to improvements in cardiovascular function, including a reduction in pulmonary artery pressure, systemic blood pressure and endothelial dysfunction. However, studies exploring the outcomes of treatment of SDB in children on the cardiovascular system are limited and varied in their methodology and outcome measures. As a number of cardiovascular disturbances are sequelae of SDB, early detection and management could result in the reduction of elevated blood pressure in children, and consequently a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity in adulthood. The aim of this review is to summarise the findings of studies to date which have investigated the cardiovascular outcomes in children treated for SDB and to make recommendations for future management of this very common disease.",success

30798778,False,"Journal Article;Practice Guideline;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,,,,,,True,"This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children <15 years of age based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy. The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine. The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been <7 episodes in the past year, <5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or <3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of >1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are <2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of oSDB. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are <3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir <80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥1 of the following: temperature >38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. (1) Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. (2) There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update. (3) Inclusion of 2 consumer advocates on the guideline update group. (4) Changes to 5 KASs from the original guideline: KAS 1 (Watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection), KAS 3 (Tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors), KAS 4 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing), KAS 9 (Perioperative pain counseling), and KAS 10 (Perioperative antibiotics). (5) Seven new KASs: KAS 5 (Indications for polysomnography), KAS 6 (Additional recommendations for polysomnography), KAS 7 (Tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea), KAS 12 (Inpatient monitoring for children after tonsillectomy), KAS 13 (Postoperative ibuprofen and acetaminophen), KAS 14 (Postoperative codeine), and KAS 15a (Outcome assessment for bleeding). (6) Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs. (7) Enhanced emphasis on patient and/or caregiver education and shared decision making.",success
27840333,False,Journal Article;Practice Guideline;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone of quality cardiovascular care. In response to reports from the Institute of Medicine<sup>,</sup> and a mandate to evaluate new knowledge and maintain relevance at the point of care, the ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) modified its methodology.<sup>–</sup> The relationships among guidelines, data standards, appropriate use criteria, and performance measures are addressed elsewhere. Practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment. Guidelines are reviewed annually by the Task Force and are official policy of the ACC and AHA. Each guideline is considered current until it is updated, revised, or superseded by published addenda, statements of clarification, focused updates, or revised full-text guidelines. To ensure that guidelines remain current, new data are reviewed biannually to determine whether recommendations should be modified. In general, full revisions are posted in 5-year cycles.<sup>–</sup> Processes have evolved to support the evolution of guidelines as “living documents” that can be dynamically updated. This process delineates a recommendation to address a specific clinical question, followed by concise text (ideally <250 words) and hyperlinked to supportive evidence. This approach accommodates time constraints on busy clinicians and facilitates easier access to recommendations via electronic search engines and other evolving technology. Writing committee members review the literature; weigh the quality of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and estimate expected health outcomes. In developing recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data.<sup>–</sup> Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only selected references are cited. The Task Force recognizes the need for objective, independent Evidence Review Committees (ERCs) that include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians who systematically survey, abstract, and assess the evidence to address systematic review questions posed in the PICOTS format (P=population, I=intervention, C=comparator, O=outcome, T=timing, S=setting).<sup>,–</sup> Practical considerations, including time and resource constraints, limit the ERCs to evidence that is relevant to key clinical questions and lends itself to systematic review and analysis that could affect the strength of corresponding recommendations. The term “guideline-directed management and therapy” (GDMT) refers to care defined mainly by ACC/AHA Class I recommendations. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage with product insert material and carefully evaluate for contraindications and interactions. Recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical use in the United States. The Class of Recommendation (COR; ie, the strength of the recommendation) encompasses the anticipated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates evidence supporting the effect of the intervention on the basis of the type, quality, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other reports (Table 1).<sup>–</sup> Unless otherwise stated, recommendations are sequenced by COR and then by LOE. Where comparative data exist, preferred strategies take precedence. When >1 drug, strategy, or therapy exists within the same COR and LOE and no comparative data are available, options are listed alphabetically. The ACC and AHA sponsor the guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time. The Task Force zealously avoids actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that might arise through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). All writing committee members and reviewers are required to disclose current industry relationships or personal interests, from 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced writing committee and assuring that the chair and a majority of committee members have no relevant RWI (Appendix 1). Members are restricted with regard to writing or voting on sections to which their RWI apply. For transparency, members' comprehensive disclosure information is available online. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online. The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds representing different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice, and by inviting organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners or collaborators. Managing patients with multiple conditions can be complex, especially when recommendations applicable to coexisting illnesses are discordant or interacting. The guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances. The recommendations should not replace clinical judgment. Management in accordance with guideline recommendations is effective only when followed. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. Consequently, circumstances may arise in which deviations from these guidelines are appropriate.",success

A total of 6979 patients aged 70 years or older or aged 50 through 69 years with history of cigarette smoking or diabetes were evaluated by history and by measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). PAD was considered present if the ABI was 0.90 or less, if it was documented in the medical record, or if there was a history of limb revascularization. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined as a history of atherosclerotic coronary, cerebral, or abdominal aortic aneurysmal disease. Frequency of detection of PAD; physician and patient awareness of PAD diagnosis; treatment intensity in PAD patients compared with treatment of other forms of CVD and with patients without clinical evidence of atherosclerosis. PAD was detected in 1865 patients (29%); 825 of these (44%) had PAD only, without evidence of CVD. Overall, 13% had PAD only, 16% had PAD and CVD, 24% had CVD only, and 47% had neither PAD nor CVD (the reference group). There were 457 patients (55%) with newly diagnosed PAD only and 366 (35%) with PAD and CVD who were newly diagnosed during the survey. Eighty-three percent of patients with prior PAD were aware of their diagnosis, but only 49% of physicians were aware of this diagnosis. Among patients with PAD, classic claudication was distinctly uncommon (11%). Patients with PAD had similar atherosclerosis risk factor profiles compared with those who had CVD. Smoking behavior was more frequently treated in patients with new (53%) and prior PAD (51%) only than in those with CVD only (35%; P <.001). Hypertension was treated less frequently in new (84%) and prior PAD (88%) only vs CVD only (95%; P <.001) and hyperlipidemia was treated less frequently in new (44%) and prior PAD (56%) only vs CVD only (73%, P<.001). Antiplatelet medications were prescribed less often in patients with new (33%) and prior PAD (54%) only vs CVD only (71%, P<.001). Treatment intensity for diabetes and use of hormone replacement therapy in women were similar across all groups. Prevalence of PAD in primary care practices is high, yet physician awareness of the PAD diagnosis is relatively low. A simple ABI measurement identified a large number of patients with previously unrecognized PAD. Atherosclerosis risk factors were very prevalent in PAD patients, but these patients received less intensive treatment for lipid disorders and hypertension and were prescribed antiplatelet therapy less frequently than were patients with CVD. These results demonstrate that underdiagnosis of PAD in primary care practice may be a barrier to effective secondary prevention of the high ischemic cardiovascular risk associated with PAD.",success

This study provides the first comparison of the prevalence of peripheral artery disease between high-income countries (HIC) and low-income or middle-income countries (LMIC), establishes the primary risk factors for peripheral artery disease in these settings, and estimates the number of people living with peripheral artery disease regionally and globally. We did a systematic review of the literature on the prevalence of peripheral artery disease in which we searched for community-based studies since 1997 that defined peripheral artery disease as an ankle brachial index (ABI) lower than or equal to 0·90. We used epidemiological modelling to define age-specific and sex-specific prevalence rates in HIC and in LMIC and combined them with UN population numbers for 2000 and 2010 to estimate the global prevalence of peripheral artery disease. Within a subset of studies, we did meta-analyses of odds ratios (ORs) associated with 15 putative risk factors for peripheral artery disease to estimate their effect size in HIC and LMIC. We then used the risk factors to predict peripheral artery disease numbers in eight WHO regions (three HIC and five LMIC). 34 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, 22 from HIC and 12 from LMIC, including 112,027 participants, of which 9347 had peripheral artery disease. Sex-specific prevalence rates increased with age and were broadly similar in HIC and LMIC and in men and women. The prevalence in HIC at age 45-49 years was 5·28% (95% CI 3·38-8·17%) in women and 5·41% (3·41-8·49%) in men, and at age 85-89 years, it was 18·38% (11·16-28·76%) in women and 18·83% (12·03-28·25%) in men. Prevalence in men was lower in LMIC than in HIC (2·89% [2·04-4·07%] at 45-49 years and 14·94% [9·58-22·56%] at 85-89 years). In LMIC, rates were higher in women than in men, especially at younger ages (6·31% [4·86-8·15%] of women aged 45-49 years). Smoking was an important risk factor in both HIC and LMIC, with meta-OR for current smoking of 2·72 (95% CI 2·39-3·09) in HIC and 1·42 (1·25-1·62) in LMIC, followed by diabetes (1·88 [1·66-2·14] vs 1·47 [1·29-1·68]), hypertension (1·55 [1·42-1·71] vs 1·36 [1·24-1·50]), and hypercholesterolaemia (1·19 [1·07-1·33] vs 1·14 [1·03-1·25]). Globally, 202 million people were living with peripheral artery disease in 2010, 69·7% of them in LMIC, including 54·8 million in southeast Asia and 45·9 million in the western Pacific Region. During the preceding decade the number of individuals with peripheral artery disease increased by 28·7% in LMIC and 13·1% in HIC. In the 21st century, peripheral artery disease has become a global problem.

We aimed to provide the first estimation on the prevalence, number of cases, and risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in the general population globally and regionally. In this systematic review, meta-analysis, and modelling study, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure for articles published from database inception until May 7, 2019, with no language restrictions, for population-based studies that quantified prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis by means of increased carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and carotid stenosis. Studies were eligible if they included bilaterally scanned carotid arteries using ultrasonography and defined increased carotid intima-media thickness as a thickness of 1·0 mm or more, carotid plaque as a focal carotid intima-media thickness of 1·5 mm or more encroaching into the lumen or at least 0·5 mm or 50% compared with the surrounding carotid intima-media thickness values, and carotid stenosis as 50% or more stenosis. Studies were excluded if the sample was not representative of the general population. We also included studies identified in our previous systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in China. We estimated age-specific and sex-specific prevalences of increased carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and carotid stenosis. We used UN population data to generate the number of people affected in 2000, 2015, and 2020. We did random-effects meta-analyses to assess the effects of risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque. We derived regional numbers of people living with increased carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque in 2015 using a risk factors-based model by WHO region. All analyses were done in populations aged 30-79 years due to availability of data. This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered online on PROSPERO, CRD42019134709. We identified 8632 articles through our database search, of which 515 were eligible for full-text review, including 37 articles from our previous study, and 59 articles were eligible for inclusion in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Overall, in people aged 30-79 years in 2020, the global prevalence of increased carotid intima-media thickness is estimated to be 27·6% (95% CI 16·9-41·3), equivalent to 1066·70 million affected people and a percentage change of 57·46% from 2000; of carotid plaque is estimated to be 21·1% (13·2-31·5), equivalent to 815·76 million affected people and a percentage change of 58·97% from 2000; and carotid stenosis is estimated to be 1·5% (1·1-2·1), equivalent to 57·79 million affected people and a percentage change of 59·13% from 2000. The prevalence of increased carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and carotid stenosis increased consistently with age and was higher in men than in women. Current smoking, diabetes, and hypertension were common risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque. In 2015, the Western Pacific region had the largest share of global cases of increased carotid intima-media thickness (317·62 million [33·36%] of 952·13 million affected people) and carotid plaque (240·77 million [33·20%] of 725·25 million), whereas the African region had the smallest share of cases of increased carotid intima-media thickness (59·08 million [6·21%]) and the Eastern Mediterranean region had the smallest share of carotid plaque cases (44·59 million [6·15%]). A substantial global burden of carotid atherosclerosis exists. Effective strategies are needed for primary prevention and management of carotid atherosclerosis. High-quality epidemiological investigations on carotid atherosclerosis are needed to better address the global burden of carotid atherosclerosis at finer levels. None.",success

GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 257 to 285 million) in 1990 to 523 million (95% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the number of CVD deaths steadily increased from 12.1 million (95% UI:11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching 18.6 million (95% UI: 17.1 to 19.7 million) in 2019. The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also increased significantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4 million (95% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95% UI: 8.40 to 9.74 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 197 million (95% UI: 178 to 220 million) prevalent cases of IHD in 2019. The total number of DALYs due to stroke has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 143 million (95% UI: 133 to 153 million) DALYs, 6.55 million (95% UI: 6.00 to 7.02 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 101 million (95% UI: 93.2 to 111 million) prevalent cases of stroke in 2019. Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of disease burden in the world. CVD burden continues its decades-long rise for almost all countries outside high-income countries, and alarmingly, the age-standardized rate of CVD has begun to rise in some locations where it was previously declining in high-income countries. There is an urgent need to focus on implementing existing cost-effective policies and interventions if the world is to meet the targets for Sustainable Development Goal 3 and achieve a 30% reduction in premature mortality due to noncommunicable diseases.",success

Data were collected from seven community-based studies that assessed subjects for the presence of PAD using the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Using standardized weighting criteria, age-, gender-, and ethnic-specific prevalence rates were computed and then multiplied by the corresponding 2000 Census population totals to estimate the burden of PAD in the United States for that year. Evidence-based adjustments for studies which did not consider possible subclavian stenosis, prior revascularization for PAD, or both were employed. In 2000, it is conservatively estimated that at least 6.8 million (5.8%) individuals aged 40 years or older had PAD based on an ABI of less than 0.9 or previous revascularization for PAD, and that that there are an additional 1.7 million Americans with PAD but ""normal"" ABIs. Including this group gives a total of 8.5 million (7.2%) individuals with PAD. Roughly one in 16 individuals residing in the United States in 2000 who were aged 40 years and older had PAD.

These Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) are focused on definition, evaluation, and management of CLTI with the goals of improving evidence-based care and highlighting critical research needs. The term CLTI is preferred over critical limb ischemia, as the latter implies threshold values of impaired perfusion rather than a continuum. CLTI is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in combination with rest pain, gangrene, or a lower limb ulceration >2 weeks duration. Venous, traumatic, embolic, and nonatherosclerotic etiologies are excluded. All patients with suspected CLTI should be referred urgently to a vascular specialist. Accurately staging the severity of limb threat is fundamental, and the Society for Vascular Surgery Threatened Limb Classification system, based on grading of Wounds, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) is endorsed. Objective hemodynamic testing, including toe pressures as the preferred measure, is required to assess CLTI. Evidence-based revascularization (EBR) hinges on three independent axes: Patient risk, Limb severity, and ANatomic complexity (PLAN). Average-risk and high-risk patients are defined by estimated procedural and 2-year all-cause mortality. The GVG proposes a new Global Anatomic Staging System (GLASS), which involves defining a preferred target artery path (TAP) and then estimating limb-based patency (LBP), resulting in three stages of complexity for intervention. The optimal revascularization strategy is also influenced by the availability of autogenous vein for open bypass surgery. Recommendations for EBR are based on best available data, pending level 1 evidence from ongoing trials. Vein bypass may be preferred for average-risk patients with advanced limb threat and high complexity disease, while those with less complex anatomy, intermediate severity limb threat, or high patient risk may be favored for endovascular intervention. All patients with CLTI should be afforded best medical therapy including the use of antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and glycemic control agents, as well as counseling on smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and preventive foot care. Following EBR, long-term limb surveillance is advised. The effectiveness of nonrevascularization therapies (eg, spinal stimulation, pneumatic compression, prostanoids, and hyperbaric oxygen) has not been established. Regenerative medicine approaches (eg, cell, gene therapies) for CLTI should be restricted to rigorously conducted randomizsed clinical trials. The GVG promotes standardization of study designs and end points for clinical trials in CLTI.

This was a retrospective cohort analysis of adults with commercial, Medicare supplemental, or Medicaid health insurance who had at least one PAD or CLI health care claim from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008, and 12 months of continuous coverage. Two subgroups of CLI presentation were identified: primary CLI (patients without any prior PAD or subsequent PAD diagnostic code >30 days after CLI diagnostic code) and secondary CLI (patients with prior PAD or subsequent PAD diagnostic codes ≤30 days of a CLI diagnostic code). Patterns of presentation, annual incidence, and prevalence of CLI were stratified by health care plan. Risk factors for progression to CLI were compared by presentation type. From 2003 to 2008, the mean annual incidence of PAD was 2.35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.34%-2.36%) and the incidence of CLI was 0.35% (95% CI, 0.34%-0.35%) of the eligible study population, with primary and secondary presentations occurring at similar rates.

We compared the cost utilization and in-hospital outcomes of endovascular and surgical revascularization procedures for CLI. CLI and revascularization procedures were identified using International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Edition-Clinical Modification codes. In-hospital mortality and amputation were coprimary outcomes. Length of stay (LOS) and cost of hospitalization were secondary outcomes. We included a total of 642,433 admissions with CLI across 2003 to 2011.

This was accompanied by a steady reduction in the incidence of in-hospital mortality and major amputation. Compared to surgical revascularization, endovascular revascularization was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (2.34% vs. 2.73%, p < 0.001), mean LOS (8.7 days vs. 10.7 days, p < 0.001), and mean cost of hospitalization ($31,679 vs. $32,485, p < 0.001) despite similar rates of major amputation (6.5% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.75).

Then, we used Markov Monte Carlo simulations in a simulated cohort of 100 000 individuals to estimate lifetime risk of PAD. On the basis of odds ratios of PAD for traditional atherosclerotic risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and smoking), we developed a calculator providing residual lifetime risk of PAD. In an 80-year horizon, lifetime risks of PAD were 30.0% in black men and 27.6% in black women, but ≈19% in white men and women and ≈22% in Hispanic men and women. From another perspective, 9% of blacks were estimated to develop PAD by 60 years of age, while the same proportion was seen at ≈70 years for whites and Hispanics. The residual lifetime risk within the same race/ethnicity varied by 3.5- to 5-fold according to risk factors (eg, residual lifetime risk in 45-year-old black men was 19.9% when current smoking, diabetes mellitus, and history of cardiovascular disease were absent versus 70.4% when all were present).

On multivariable analysis, the odds for having progressed into the low ABI group were significantly increased for higher baseline age, hypertension, diabetes, greater pack-years of cigarette smoking, and homocysteine levels. The odds for progression into the high ABI group were increased for male gender and higher body mass index. Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans had a significantly higher odds for progression to the low ABI group (odds ratio [OR]: 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-3.88) while having a reduced odds for progression to the high ABI group (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.24-1.00).

A cross-sectional study was designed as part of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a multicenter United States population study. We selected a subgroup of participants with unequivocally normal ABIs (1.00 to 1.30), and additionally excluded participants with any major PAD risk factor (smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension). In a linear model with ABI as the dependent variable, demographic, clinical, biologic, and social variables were introduced as independent factors. Among 1775 healthy participants, there was no association between ABI level and subclinical cardiovascular disease (coronary calcium or carotid plaque). Male gender, weight, and high education level were positively correlated with ABI, whereas black race, triglycerides, pack-years (in past smokers), and pulse pressure were negatively correlated. In the fully adjusted model, women had about 0.02 lower ABI values than men, and blacks showed ABI values about 0.02 lower than non-Hispanic whites.

Measuring it requires a hand-held Doppler probe but it can be done also with an automatic device. ABI is an effective tool for clinical practice or clinical studies. However, in diabetic patients, it has some specific caveats. Sensitivity of the standard threshold of 0.9 appears to be lower in diabetic patients with complications. Moreover, highly frequent arterial medial calcifications in diabetes increase ABI. It has been demonstrated that measurements >1.3 are well correlated with both an increased prevalence of PAD and CV risk. Therefore, ABI thresholds of less than 0.9 and more than 1.3 are highly suspicious for PAD and high CV risk in diabetic patients. However, when there is concomitant clinical peripheral neuropathy or high risk of arterial calcification, the efficiency of ABI seems to be limited. In this case, other methods should be applied, toe pressure, in particular. Thus, the ABI could be used in patients with diabetes, but values should be interpreted with precision, according to the clinical situation.",success

For both series, two observers independently assessed the anterior tibial, posterior tibial and peroneal arteries of both legs for following criteria: arterial enhancement, presence and degree of stenosis, the confidence of grading, degree of stenosis and venous overlay. Quantitative assessment of arterial enhancement was performed by measuring the mean CT values (HU) in all arteries. Radiation exposure was quantified by the effective dose. A total of 118 arteries were assessed. The observer study showed that the additional time-resolved series improved both arterial enhancement (64% considered optimal enhanced versus 44%) and diagnostic confidence (59% considered as certain versus 33%) for the assessment of arterial stenosis (all p < 0.05). Venous overlay reduced from 15% to 6%. In all three arteries, the measured contrast enhancement by CT values (HU) was considerably higher (average 48%, p <  0.05) with the time-resolved series.

A sequential two-compartment model was used. Differences in CTP parameters and correlations between CTP, hemodynamic and angiographic parameters were assessed with non-parametric tests. The cohort consisted of 27 subjects with an occlusion, and eight with a high-grade stenosis. The mean blood flow (BF) was 7.71 ± 2.96 ml/100ml*min-1, mean blood volume (BV) 0.71 ± 0.33 ml/100ml, and mean mean transit time (MTT) 7.22 ± 2.66 s. BF and BV were higher in subjects with longer lesions, and BV was higher in subjects with lower ABI. Significant correlations were found between lesion length and BV (r = 0.65) and BF (r = 0.52). Significant inverse correlations were found between BV and ABI and between BV and ABP (r = -0.56, for both correlations). In our study, we have shown the feasibility of CTP for the assessment of PAD. In the future, this quantitative method might serve as a non-invasive method, possibly complementing the diagnostic workup of patients with peripheral arterial disease.",success

Four weeks postocclusion, postmortem tissue 201Tl activity was measured by gamma counting, and immunohistochemistry was performed to assess capillary density. Relative 201Tl retention (ischemic/nonischemic) was reduced immediately postocclusion in distal and proximal muscles and remained lower in calf and gluteus muscles 4 weeks later. Analysis of CT angiography revealed collateralization at 4 weeks within proximal muscles (P<0.05). SPECT perfusion correlated with tissue gamma counting at 4 weeks (P=0.01).

The USPSTF found few data on the accuracy of the ABI for identifying asymptomatic persons who can benefit from treatment of PAD or CVD. There are few studies addressing the benefits of treating screen-detected patients with PAD; 2 good-quality studies showed no benefit of using the ABI to manage daily aspirin therapy in unselected populations, and 2 studies showed no benefit from exercise therapy. No studies addressed the harms of screening, although the potential exists for overdiagnosis, labeling, and opportunity costs.

Multivariate propensity-matched analyses were performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics, procedural indications, and comorbidities on the basis of sex. Compared with men, women were older and have multilevel disease and critical limb ischemia. In a propensity-matched analysis, female sex was associated with a higher rate of vascular complications, transfusions, and embolism. No differences were observed for in-hospital death, myocardial infarction, or stroke or transient ischemic attack. Technical success was more commonly achieved in women (91.2% vs. 89.1%, p = 0.014), but because of a higher complication rate, the overall procedural success rates were similar in men and women (79.7% vs. 81.6%, p = 0.08).

3552530,False,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;Review",,,,,,,,True,"Diabetes is associated with changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins into atherogenic direction. In IDDM these changes are small or absent if good metabolic control can be maintained. Diabetic nephropathy is, however, associated with the appearance of dyslipoproteinemia. In NIDDM plasma total and VLDL triglyceride levels are elevated, and HDL-cholesterol level is decreased, and this pattern of dyslipoproteinemia does not always respond to improved control of hyperglycemia. Abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism, not reflected in conventional plasma lipid and lipoprotein level measurements, and glucosylation of lipoproteins and resulting alterations in lipoprotein catabolism may be of importance in the enhanced atherogenesis in diabetes. Both IDDM and NIDDM are associated with an increased frequency of hypertension, but the underlying mechanisms appear to be different. In IDDM hypertension is usually associated with the development of diabetic nephropathy and thus with a long duration of the disease. In NIDDM hypertension is often present already at the time of diagnosis, and also in IGT, the precursor stage of NIDDM, the prevalence of hypertension is already increased. Obesity explains only in part the high prevalence of hypertension in patients with NIDDM. Diabetes is known to be associated with multiple abnormalities in hemostatic factors and, although these abnormalities may contribute importantly to the increased risk of ASVD in diabetic patients, information about their real role is scanty and conflicting. The impact of general major risk factors for ASVD, elevated plasma cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and smoking, on the risk of ASVD appears to be similar in diabetics and nondiabetics. Only a relatively small proportion of the excessive occurrence of ASVD in diabetics can, however, be explained by the effects of diabetes on the levels of general risk factors for ASVD. This proportion mediated through the effects of diabetes on risk factors is larger in female diabetics than in male diabetics. The major proportion of the excess of ASVD in diabetics remains, however, unexplained and must be due to effects of diabetes itself through mechanisms that are incompletely understood.",success

We analysed data from 414 523 people with diabetes enrolled in practices associated with The Health Improvement Network in the United Kingdom. Our methods were designed to control for potential confounders in order to isolate the relationship between diabetic foot ulcers and death. Using proportional hazards models and the area under the receiver operator curve, we evaluated the effects of diabetic foot ulcers and the covariates on death. Among the patients, 20 737 developed diabetic foot ulcers; 5.0% of people with new ulcers died within 12 months of their first foot ulcer visit and 42.2% of people with foot ulcers died within 5 years. After controlling for major known complications of diabetes that might influence mortality, the correlation between diabetic foot ulcers and death remained strong with a fully adjusted hazard ratio of 2.48 (95% confidence interval: 2.43, 2.54). Geographic variance existed but was not spatially associated. Diabetic foot ulcers are linked to an increased risk of death. This cannot be explained by other common risk factors. These results suggest that either there are major unknown risk factors associated with both diabetic foot ulcers and death, or that diabetic foot ulceration itself is a serious threat, which seems unlikely.

The basis of this classification is centred on three fundamental variables that are present in the assessment of risk and indication: (1) presence or absence of neuropathy (the loss of protective sensation); (2) presence or absence of an open wound; (3) presence or absence of acute limb-threatening infection. The conceptual framework for this classification is to define distinct classes of surgery in an order of theoretically increasing risk for high-level amputation. These include: Class I: elective diabetic foot surgery (procedures performed to treat a painful deformity in a patient without the loss of protective sensation); Class II: prophylactic (procedure performed to reduce the risk of ulceration or reulceration in a person with the loss of protective sensation but without an open wound); Class III: curative (procedure performed to assist in healing an open wound); and Class IV: emergency (procedure performed to limit the progression of acute infection). The presence of critical ischaemia in any of these classes of surgery should prompt a vascular evaluation to consider (1) the urgency of the procedure being considered and (2) possible revascularization prior to or temporally concomitant with the procedure.

Where possible, outcome data, expressed in terms of prevalence or incidence, were recalculated as odds ratio or relative risk, with never-smokers as the reference group, or if this was not available the nonsmoker group. Most studies did not provide primary data. Therefore the weighted means were reported as a summary estimate, provided that a funnel plot between sample size and observed effect size made publication bias unlikely.

A clear dose-response relationship, with a strong increase in risk for PAD in heavy smokers was observed. In countries where approximately 30% of the population are smokers, 50% of PAD can be attributed to smoking. Smoking is a potent risk factor for symptomatic PAD, with an important and consistent dose-response relationship.

One thousand five hundred and ninety-two subjects aged 55-74 years were selected randomly from the age-sex registers of 10 general practices in Edinburgh, Scotland. The presence of peripheral arterial disease was determined by the World Health Organisation questionnaire on intermittent claudication, the ankle brachial pressure index and a reactive hyperaemia test. Heart disease was identified by the patients' recall of a doctor diagnosis of angina or myocardial infarction. There were 131 subjects with peripheral arterial disease but no ischaemic heart disease, and 169 with heart disease without peripheral disease. Significantly more smokers occurred in the peripheral than the heart disease group (P <0.01), and in current smokers the age and sex adjusted odds ratio were highly significant for peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 5.09, 95% confidence interval 2.97-8.72, P<0.001), but not for heart disease (odds ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 0.98-2.33, P>0.05). Subjects with lower limb disease also had higher systolic pressures (P<0.001), serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (P<0.01) and plasma fibrinogen (P<0.05). On logistic regression, adjusting for a range of individual risk factors had no significant impact on the effect of smoking. Plasma fibrinogen produced the biggest reduction in odds ratio (4.23, 95% confidence interval 2.44-7.35, in current smokers with peripheral arterial disease).

Atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by increased small LDL particle (LDL-P) concentration, rather than total LDL cholesterol content, along with elevated triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), may be the primary lipid driver of PAD risk. The study population was a prospective cohort study of 27 888 women ≥45 years old free of cardiovascular disease at baseline and followed for a median of 15.1 years. We tested whether standard lipid concentrations, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-derived lipoprotein measures, were associated with incident symptomatic PAD (n=110) defined as claudication and/or revascularization. In age-adjusted analyses, while LDL cholesterol was not associated with incident PAD, we found significant associations for increased total and small LDL-P concentrations, triglycerides, and concentrations of very LDL (VLDL) particle (VLDL-P) subclasses, increased total cholesterol (TC):HDL-C, low HDL-C, and low HDL particle (HDL-P) concentration (all P for extreme tertile comparisons <0.05).

These components of atherogenic dyslipidemia, including small LDL-P, medium and very large VLDL-P, TC:HDL-C, HDL-C, and HDL-P, were more strongly associated with incident PAD than incident coronary and cerebrovascular disease. Finally, the addition of LDL-P and HDL-P concentration to TC:HDL-C measures identified women at heightened PAD risk. In this prospective study, nuclear magnetic resonance-derived measures of LDL-P, but not LDL cholesterol, were associated with incident PAD.

After taking into account potential confounding by other pollutants, we found consistent evidence that the level of PM10 is associated with the rate of death from all causes and from cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. The estimated increase in the relative rate of death from all causes was 0.51 percent (95 percent posterior interval, 0.07 to 0.93 percent) for each increase in the PM10 level of 10 microg per cubic meter. The estimated increase in the relative rate of death from cardiovascular and respiratory causes was 0.68 percent (95 percent posterior interval, 0.20 to 1.16 percent) for each increase in the PM10 level of 10 microg per cubic meter. There was weaker evidence that increases in ozone levels increased the relative rates of death during the summer, when ozone levels are highest, but not during the winter. Levels of the other pollutants were not significantly related to the mortality rate. There is consistent evidence that the levels of fine particulate matter in the air are associated with the risk of death from all causes and from cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses.

Between 1987 and 1989 in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) study, an oscillometric device was used to measure blood pressure in a single upper and randomly chosen lower extremity to determine the ABI. Incident HF events were defined by the first hospitalization with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code of 428.x through 2008. The risk for HF was assessed across the ABI range using restricted cubic splines and Cox proportional hazards models. ABI was available in 13,150 participants free from prevalent HF. Over a mean 17.7 years of follow-up, 1,809 incident HF events occurred. After adjustment for traditional HF risk factors, prevalent coronary heart disease, subclinical carotid atherosclerosis, and interim myocardial infarction, compared with an ABI of 1.01 to 1.40, participants with ABIs ≤0.90 were at increased risk for HF (hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.74), as were participants with ABIs of 0.91 to 1.00 (hazard ratio: 1.36; 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 1.59). In a middle-age community cohort, an ABI ≤1.00 was significantly associated with an increased risk for HF, independent of traditional HF risk factors, prevalent coronary heart disease, carotid atherosclerosis, and interim myocardial infarction. Low ABI may reflect not only overt atherosclerosis but also pathologic processes in the development of HF beyond epicardial atherosclerotic disease and myocardial infarction alone.

We aimed to examine smoking rates and smoking cessation interventions offered to patients with PAD consulting a vascular specialty clinic; and assess changes in smoking behavior over the year following initial visit. Methods and Results A total of 1272 patients with PAD and new or worsening claudication were enrolled at 16 vascular specialty clinics (2011-2015, PORTRAIT (Patient-Centered Outcomes Related to Treatment Practices in Peripheral Arterial Disease: Investigating Trajectories) registry). Interviews collected smoking status and cessation interventions at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Among smokers, transition state models analyzed smoking transitions at each time point and identified factors associated with quitting and relapse. On presentation, 474 (37.3%) patients were active, 660 (51.9%) former, and 138 (10.8%) never smokers. Among active smokers, only 16% were referred to cessation counseling and 11% were prescribed pharmacologic treatment.

Randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated the benefits of SET in improving maximum walking distance in intermittent claudication patients, and society guidelines recommend SET as first-line therapy. In 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) added coverage of SET. We aimed to evaluate the availability and use of SET programs, determine the awareness of SET CMS coverage in the United States, and gauge the academic interest in SET in the vascular community. An eight-question online survey regarding SET coverage, reimbursement, barriers to prescription, and SET use was sent to 900 vascular surgeons, cardiologists, and vascular medicine physicians across the United States. The most recent 2-year programs for the Vascular Annual Meeting, Midwestern Vascular Society, Eastern Vascular Society, and Western Vascular Society were reviewed to identify SET-related abstracts and gauge academic interest and awareness for SET within the vascular surgery community. We received 135 physician responses (15%) to the survey. All 50 states were represented. The majority of responders (54%) stated that there was no SET program at their facility, and 5% did not know if there was a SET program available. Of those who did have a SET program available, 81% were associated with cardiac rehabilitation and 19% had a PAD-specific program. A significant number of physicians (49%) had never referred a patient for SET. Twenty-six percent were not aware that CMS covered SET sessions. Of the physicians who were aware of CMS reimbursement, 36% had never referred a patient to a SET program. Of all surveyed, 98% indicated they would refer patients to a SET program if one was available. Top barriers to use of a SET program included (1) no SET center availability and (2) significant cost or travel expense to the patient. A review of major vascular surgery meeting programs for the last 2 years yielded no identification of a SET-related abstract. There is a lack of both availability and use of SET for patients with PAD with claudication, despite guideline recommendations and CMS reimbursement for SET sessions in the United States. When SET is offered, it is typically through cardiac rehabilitation programs which is not focused on PAD. Travel distance, lack of SET program availability, and low reimbursement rates are primary areas that could be addressed to improve use.",success

We used 100% Medicare fee-for-service claims to identify patients diagnosed with claudication for the first time between 2015 and 2017. Early PVI was defined as an aortoiliac or femoropopliteal PVI performed within 6 months of initial claudication diagnosis. A physician-level PVI utilization rate was calculated for physicians who diagnosed >10 claudication patients and performed at least one PVI (regardless of indication) during the study period. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to identify physician-level factors associated with early PVI. Of 194,974 patients who had a first-time diagnosis of claudication during the study period, 6286 (3.2%) underwent early PVI. Among the 5664 physicians included in the analysis, the median physician-level early PVI rate was low at 0% (range, 0%-58.3%). However, there were 320 physicians (5.6%) who had an early PVI rate ≥14% (≥2 standard deviations above the mean).

24126108,False,Journal Article;Practice Guideline,,,,,,,,True,"Critical limb ischemia, first defined in 1982, was intended to delineate a subgroup of patients with a threatened lower extremity primarily because of chronic ischemia. It was the intent of the original authors that patients with diabetes be excluded or analyzed separately. The Fontaine and Rutherford Systems have been used to classify risk of amputation and likelihood of benefit from revascularization by subcategorizing patients into two groups: ischemic rest pain and tissue loss. Due to demographic shifts over the last 40 years, especially a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes mellitus and rapidly expanding techniques of revascularization, it has become increasingly difficult to perform meaningful outcomes analysis for patients with threatened limbs using these existing classification systems. Particularly in patients with diabetes, limb threat is part of a broad disease spectrum. Perfusion is only one determinant of outcome; wound extent and the presence and severity of infection also greatly impact the threat to a limb. Therefore, the Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Guidelines Committee undertook the task of creating a new classification of the threatened lower extremity that reflects these important considerations. We term this new framework, the Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Threatened Limb Classification System. Risk stratification is based on three major factors that impact amputation risk and clinical management: Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI). The implementation of this classification system is intended to permit more meaningful analysis of outcomes for various forms of therapy in this challenging, but heterogeneous population.",success

In our regional vascular quality improvement collaborative, we compared 2350 patients undergoing primary infrainguinal LEB with 1154 patients undergoing secondary infrainguinal LEB (LEB performed after previous revascularization in the index limb) between 2003 and 2011. The proportion of patients undergoing secondary LEB increased by 72% during the study period (22% of all LEBs in 2003 to 38% in 2011, P<0.001). In-hospital outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, death, and amputation, were similar between primary and secondary LEB groups. However, in both crude and propensity-weighted analyses, secondary LEB was associated with significantly inferior 1-year outcomes, including major adverse limb event-free survival (composite of death, new bypass graft, surgical bypass graft revision, thrombectomy/thrombolysis, or above-ankle amputation; Secondary LEB MALE-free survival = 61.6% vs primary LEB MALE-free survival = 67.5%, P=0.002) and reintervention or amputation-free survival (composite of death, reintervention, or above-ankle amputation; Secondary LEB RAO-free survival = 58.9% vs Primary LEB RAO-free survival 64.1%, P=0.003). Inferior outcomes for secondary LEB were observed regardless of the prior failed treatment type (PVI or LEB). In an era of increasing utilization of PVI, a growing proportion of patients undergo LEB in the setting of a prior failed PVI or surgical bypass.

Secondary objectives included the identification of factors which could have influenced general findings. Recently several randomized trials comparing drug-coated balloon (DCB) with conventional plain balloon (PB) for the treatment of femoropopliteal artery disease have been reported, but no updated meta-analyses are available and questions remain surrounding the long-term antirestenotic effectiveness of the 2 therapies. We searched main electronic databases for randomized trials comparing DCB and PB for femoropopliteal artery disease. Random effects models were used to estimate the risk of TLR and all-cause death at 12 months, whereas long-term TLR and death risk were assessed by mixed effects Poisson regression models and incident rates of each outcome per patient-year. Main analyses were supplemented by sensitivity analyses, Bayesian estimates, and trial sequential analysis. A total of 8 eligible trials were identified. DCB was associated with a marked 12-month TLR risk reduction as compared with PB (risk ratio: 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19 to 0.57). The risk of death was similar between groups (risk ratio: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.95). Long-term outcomes assessment showed a reduced incidence of TLR with DCB (0.35; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.51) and a similar incidence of all-cause death (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.60 to 2.15). Similar findings were observed in Bayesian analyses. Significant heterogeneity was present with evidence of differential efficacy across devices. Trial sequential analysis indicated that available evidence is sufficient to prove superior antirestenotic efficacy of DCB over PB. DCB significantly reduces the risk of TLR as compared with PB without any effect on all-cause death. Evidence exists for differential efficacy according to the type of device used.

A prospective economic study was performed alongside the IN.PACT SFA II (IN.PACT Admiral Drug-Coated Balloon vs. Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of Superficial Femoral Artery [SFA] and Proximal Popliteal Artery [PPA]) trial, which randomized 181 patients with femoropopliteal disease to the IN.PACT DCB versus standard PTA. Resource use data were collected over 2-year follow-up, and costs were assigned using resource-based accounting and billing data. Health utilities were assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimensions questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was assessed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using a decision-analytic model on the basis of empirical data from the trial assuming identical long-term mortality. Initial costs were $1,129 per patient higher with DCB angioplasty than standard PTA, driven by higher costs for the DCB itself. Between discharge and 24 months, target limb-related costs were $1,212 per patient lower with DCB angioplasty such that discounted 2-year costs were similar for the 2 groups ($11,277 vs. $11,359, p = 0.97), whereas QALYs tended to be greater among patients treated with DCBs (1.53 ± 0.44 vs. 1.47 ± 0.42, p = 0.40).

A search for randomized controlled trials comparing DCB with POBA for treatment of SFA disease was performed. Hazard ratios were extracted to account for the time-to-event primary outcome of target lesion revascularization. Odds ratios were calculated for the secondary outcomes of primary patency (PP) and major amputation. Incorporating pooled data from the meta-analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, assuming a payer perspective, used a decision model to simulate patency at 1 year and 2 years for each index treatment modality: POBA, BMS, DCB, or DES. Costs were based on current Medicare outpatient reimbursement rates. Eight studies (1352 patients) met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. DCB outperformed POBA with respect to target lesion revascularization over time (pooled hazard ratio, 0.41; P < .001). Risk of major amputation at 12 months was not significantly different between groups. There was significantly improved 1-year PP in the DCB group compared with POBA (pooled odds ratio, 3.30; P < .001). In the decision model, the highest PP at 1 year was seen in the DES index therapy strategy (79%), followed by DCB (74%), BMS (71%), and POBA (64%). With a baseline cost of $9259.39 per patent limb at 1 year in the POBA-first group, the incremental cost per patent limb for each other strategy compared with POBA was calculated: $14,136.10/additional patent limb for DCB, $38,549.80/limb for DES, and $59,748,85/limb for BMS. The primary BMS option is dominated by being more expensive and less effective than DCB. Compared directly with DCB, DES costs $87,377.20 per additional patent limb at 1 year. Based on the projected PP at 1 year in the decision model, the number needed to treat for DES compared with DCB is 20. At current reimbursement, the use of more than two DCBs per procedure would no longer be cost-effective compared with DES. At 2 years, DCB emerges as the most cost-effective index strategy with the lowest overall cost and highest patency rates over that time horizon. Current data and reimbursements support the use of DCB as a cost-effective strategy for endovascular intervention in the SFA; any additional effectiveness of DES comes at a high price.

In-hospital mortality was higher in women regardless of disease severity or procedure performed even after adjusting for age and baseline comorbidities (.5% vs .2% after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting for intermittent claudication; 1.0% vs .7% after open surgery for intermittent claudication; 2.3% vs 1.6% after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting for CLI; 2.7% vs 2.2% after open surgery for CLI; P < .01 for all comparisons). There appears to be a preference to perform endovascular over surgical revascularization among women, who are older and have more advanced disease at presentation. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting continues to be popular and is increasingly being performed in the outpatient setting. Amputation and in-hospital mortality rates have been declining, and women now have lower amputation but higher mortality rates than men. Recent improvements in outcomes are likely the result of a combination of improved medical management and risk factor reduction.",success

Whether endovascular interventions substitute for conventional bypass surgery or are simply additive has not been investigated, and their effect on amputation rates is unknown. We sought to analyze trends in lower extremity endovascular interventions (angioplasty and atherectomy), lower extremity bypass surgery, and major amputation (above and below-knee) in Medicare beneficiaries between 1996 and 2006. We used 100% samples of Medicare Part B claims to calculate annual procedure rates of lower extremity bypass surgery, endovascular interventions (angioplasty and atherectomy), and major amputation between 1996 and 2006. Using physician specialty identifiers, we also examined trends in the specialty performing the primary procedure. Between 1996 and 2006, the rate of major lower extremity amputation declined significantly (263 to 188 per 100,000; risk ratio [RR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-0.8). Endovascular interventions increased more than threefold (from 138 to 455 per 100,000; RR = 3.30; 95% CI: 2.9-3.7) while bypass surgery decreased by 42% (219 to 126 per 100,000; RR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.5-0.7). The increase in endovascular interventions consisted both of a growth in peripheral angioplasty (from 135 to 337 procedures per 100,000; RR = 2.49; 95% CI: 2.2-2.8) and the advent of percutaneous atherectomy (from 3 to 118 per 100,000; RR = 43.12; 95% CI: 34.8-52.0). While radiologists performed the majority of endovascular interventions in 1996, more than 80% were performed by cardiologists and vascular surgeons by 2006. Overall, the total number of all lower extremity vascular procedures almost doubled over the decade (from 357 to 581 per 100,000; RR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.5-1.8). Endovascular interventions are now performed much more commonly than bypass surgery in the treatment of lower extremity PAD. These changes far exceed simple substitution, as more than three additional endovascular interventions were performed for every one procedure declined in lower extremity bypass surgery. During this same time period, major lower extremity amputation rates have fallen by more than 25%. However, further study is needed before any causal link can be established between lower extremity vascular procedures and improved rates of limb salvage in patients with PAD.",success
19341885,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Endovascular procedures are increasingly used in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Whether this new procedural approach translates to clinical outcomes equivalent or superior to open surgical revascularization is a subject of debate. We sought to analyze population-based rates of major amputations for PAD during a time period in which the use of endovascular surgical procedures increased dramatically. We used the 1996-2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) to analyze rates of amputations and vascular interventions, and also to characterize the treatment of patients admitted acutely for PAD. Vascular interventions were designated based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) procedure codes as open bypass, endovascular intervention, or major amputation (disarticulation at ankle or higher amputation). Population-based age-adjusted incidence rates of treatment were calculated by combining procedure rates with census data. Our analysis included 97,000 acute admissions for PAD, 83,000 major amputations, 77,500 endovascular procedures, and 171,000 open vascular bypass operations. Between 1996 and 2005, population-based rates of acute admissions for PAD decreased by 4.3% per year, open procedures by 6.6% per year, and major amputations by 6.4% per year, whereas endovascular procedures increased by 4.8% per year. Of patients acutely admitted for PAD, the likelihood of undergoing an amputation decreased (30.2% to 21.8%), the likelihood of undergoing an open vascular procedure decreased (34.5% to 26.3%), and the likelihood of undergoing an endovascular operation increased (12.7% to 28.3%). All of these changes were statistically significant at P < .05. The last decade has seen a significant increase in the use of endovascular procedures and a decrease in rates of major amputation. These trends are seen both for patients admitted with acute PAD, as well as in the population in general. While our study was not designed to demonstrate a causal relationship, our findings suggest an association between increased application of endovascular technology and reduced rates of amputation in patients with PAD.",success

The Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial demonstrated that in patients who survived >2 years, there was a significant advantage to infrainguinal bypass compared with endovascular intervention, which increased with time. Validated survival models for patients with CLTI are lacking. The Vascular Quality Initiative was interrogated for patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass or endovascular intervention for CLTI (January 2003-February 2017). Cox survival models were generated using only preoperative variables. Survival at 30 days, 2 years, and 5 years was modeled separately. Patients were defined as low risk (30-day survival >97% and 2-year survival >70%), medium risk (30-day survival 95%-97% or 2-year survival 50%-70%), and high-risk (30-day survival <95% or 2-year survival <50%). Among 38,470 unique CLTI patients, 63% (n = 24,214) underwent endovascular intervention and 37% (n = 14,256) underwent infrainguinal bypass. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival at 30 days, 2 years, and 5 years were 98%, 81%, and 69%, respectively. The proportion of patients in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups was 84%, 10%, and 6.5%, respectively. Patients in the low-risk group were significantly less likely to undergo endovascular intervention compared with those in the high-risk group (low risk, 59% endovascular; high risk, 75% endovascular; P < .0001). Independent predictors of death were similar in all three models, with greatest magnitude of effect associated with age >80 years, oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stage 5 chronic kidney disease, and bedbound status. The C index for the 30-day model, 2-year model, and 5-year model was 0.76, 0.72, and 0.71, respectively. Procedure type (open or endovascular) was not significant in any models and did not have an impact on C indices. These survival prediction models, derived from a large U.S. cohort of patients who underwent revascularization for CLTI, demonstrated good performance and should be validated. Most CLTI patients considered candidates for limb salvage were of average perioperative risk and were predicted to survive beyond 2 years. These models can differentiate patients into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups to facilitate evidence-based revascularization recommendations that are consistent with current treatment guidelines.",success

This study examined the effect of these changes using large national and regional data sets on procedure type, indications, morbidity, and on the primary target outcome: limb salvage. National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data sets and New York (NY) State inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient surgeries discharge databases from 1998 through 2007 were used to identify hospitalizations for lower extremity revascularization (LER) and major amputations. Patients were selected by cross-referencing diagnostic and procedural codes. Proportions were analyzed by chi(2) analysis, continuous variables by t test, and trends by the Poisson regression. The national per capita (100,000 population, age >40 years) volume of major amputations decreased by 38%. The volume for national and regional use of endovascular LER doubled. The volume of open LER decreased by 67% from 1998 through 2007. Ambulatory endovascular LER grew in NY State from 7 per capita in 1998 to 22 in 2007. Interventions declined by 20% (93 to 75) for critical limb ischemia (CLI) but increased by nearly 50% for claudication. Outpatient data analysis revealed a fivefold increase in vascular interventions for CLI and claudication. Nationally, endovascular LER interventions quadrupled (8% to 32%) for CLI and doubled (26% to 61%) for claudication. A parallel reduction occurred in major amputations for patients with CLI (42% to 30%), for other PAD diagnoses (18% to 14%), and for claudication (0.9% to 0.3%). Although surgical interventions for CLI declined significantly for octogenarians from 317 to 240, outpatient interventions increased for CLI, claudication, and other diagnoses in all age groups. Comorbidities for patients treated in 2006 were substantially greater than those of a decade ago. For most procedures, cardiac and bleeding complications have significantly decreased during the last decade. Length of stay (LOS) declined from 9.5 to 7.6 days and the percentage of short (1-2 day) hospitalizations increased from 16% to 35%. Although patients today, whether treated for claudication or CLI, have more comorbidities, the rates of amputation, the procedural morbidity and mortality, and LOS have all significantly decreased. Other variables, including changes in medical management and wound care, undoubtedly are important, but this change appears to be largely due to the widespread and successful use of endovascular LER or to earlier intervention, or both, driven by the safety of these techniques.",success

We instigated the BASIL trial to compare the outcome of bypass surgery and balloon angioplasty in such patients. We randomly assigned 452 patients, who presented to 27 UK hospitals with severe limb ischaemia due to infra-inguinal disease, to receive a surgery-first (n=228) or an angioplasty-first (n=224) strategy. The primary endpoint was amputation (of trial leg) free survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. The BASIL trial is registered with the National Research Register (NRR) and as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN45398889. The trial ran for 5.5 years, and follow-up finished when patients reached an endpoint (amputation of trial leg above the ankle or death). Seven individuals were lost to follow-up after randomisation (three assigned angioplasty, two surgery); of these, three were lost (one angioplasty, two surgery) during the first year of follow-up. 195 (86%) of 228 patients assigned to bypass surgery and 216 (96%) of 224 to balloon angioplasty underwent an attempt at their allocated intervention at a median (IQR) of 6 (3-16) and 6 (2-20) days after randomisation, respectively. At the end of follow-up, 248 (55%) patients were alive without amputation (of trial leg), 38 (8%) alive with amputation, 36 (8%) dead after amputation, and 130 (29%) dead without amputation.

We saw no difference in health-related quality of life between the two strategies, but for the first year the hospital costs associated with a surgery-first strategy were about one third higher than those with an angioplasty-first strategy. In patients presenting with severe limb ischaemia due to infra-inguinal disease and who are suitable for surgery and angioplasty, a bypass-surgery-first and a balloon-angioplasty-first strategy are associated with broadly similar outcomes in terms of amputation-free survival, and in the short-term, surgery is more expensive than angioplasty.",success

The associated costs are poorly defined in the literature. We sought to determine national estimates for the costs, utilization, and outcomes of angioplasty and bypass graft for the treatment of both claudication and limb threat. We searched the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database (1999-2007), identifying patients who had an identifiable International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 diagnosis code of atherosclerotic disease (claudication [440.21] or limb threat [440.22-440.24]). Of these, only patients who underwent intervention of angioplasty ± stent (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA; 39.50-39.90]), peripheral bypass graft (BPG; 39.29) or aortofemoral bypass (ABF; 39.25) were included. We compared demographics, costs, and comorbidities, as well as multivariable-adjusted outcomes of in-hospital mortality and major amputation. Additionally, we used the New Jersey State Inpatient and Ambulatory databases in order to better understand the influence of outpatient procedures on current volume and trends. There were 563,143 patients identified (PTA: 38%, BPG: 50%, ABF: 6%; 5.1%: multiple procedure codes). Patients who had PTA and BPG were similar in age (70.4 vs 69.5 years) but older than patients who had ABF (61.8 years, P < .01). Patients who underwent PTA were more often women (PTA: 46%, BPG: 42%, ABF: 45.2%; P < .01). Average costs for PTA increased over 60% for claudication between 2001 and 2007 ($8670 to $14,084) and limb threat ($13,903 to $23,196). For BPG, average costs increased 36% for both claudication ($9322 to $12,681) and limb threat ($16,795 to $22,910).

The number of patients per year undergoing PTA increased threefold (15,903 to 46,138) for claudication and limb threat (6752 to 19,468). For BPG, procedures per year decreased approximately 40% for both claudication (13,625 to 9108) and limb threat (25,575 to 13,762). In-hospital mortality was similar for PTA and BPG groups for claudication (0.1% vs 0.2%; P = .04) and limb threat (2.1% vs 2.6%; P < .01).

PTA has altered the treatment paradigm for lower limb ischemia with an increase in costs and procedures. It is unclear if this represents an increase in patients or number of treatments per patient. Although mortality is slightly lower with PTA for all indications, amputation rates for limb-threat patients appear higher, as does the average cost.

Approximately 140 clinical sites in the United States and Canada will enroll 2100 patients with CLI who are candidates for both treatment options. A pragmatic trial design requires consensus on patient eligibility by at least 2 investigators, but leaves the choice of specific procedural strategy within the assigned revascularization approach to the individual treating investigator.

Its inflammatory characteristics are incompletely understood.<b>Objectives:</b> To define the cytokine profile of COVID-19 and to identify evidence of immunometabolic alterations in those with severe illness.<b>Methods:</b> Levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and sTNFR1 (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) were assessed in plasma from healthy volunteers, hospitalized but stable patients with COVID-19 (COVID<sub>stable</sub> patients), patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission (COVID<sub>ICU</sub> patients), and patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU support (CAP<sub>ICU</sub> patients). Immunometabolic markers were measured in circulating neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19. The acute phase response of AAT (alpha-1 antitrypsin) to COVID-19 was also evaluated.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and sTNFR1 were all increased in patients with COVID-19. COVID<sub>ICU</sub> patients could be clearly differentiated from COVID<sub>stable</sub> patients, and demonstrated higher levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and sTNFR1 but lower IL-10 than CAP<sub>ICU</sub> patients. COVID-19 neutrophils displayed altered immunometabolism, with increased cytosolic PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2), phosphorylated PKM2, HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α), and lactate. The production and sialylation of AAT increased in COVID-19, but this antiinflammatory response was overwhelmed in severe illness, with the IL-6:AAT ratio markedly higher in patients requiring ICU admission (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). In critically unwell patients with COVID-19, increases in IL-6:AAT predicted prolonged ICU stay and mortality, whereas improvement in IL-6:AAT was associated with clinical resolution (<i>P</i> < 0.0001).<b>Conclusions:</b> The COVID-19 cytokinemia is distinct from that of other types of pneumonia, leading to organ failure and ICU need.

Recent recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on swab test of the upper respiratory tract. Demographic characteristics, cardiac blood markers, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging were obtained.

Of the 100 included patients, 53 (53%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 49 (14) years. The median (IQR) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR was 71 (64-92) days. Of the 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19, 67 (67%) recovered at home, while 33 (33%) required hospitalization. At the time of CMR, high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) was detectable (greater than 3 pg/mL) in 71 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (71%) and significantly elevated (greater than 13.9 pg/mL) in 5 patients (5%). Compared with healthy controls and risk factor-matched controls, patients recently recovered from COVID-19 had lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left ventricle volumes, and raised native T1 and T2. A total of 78 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (78%) had abnormal CMR findings, including raised myocardial native T1 (n = 73), raised myocardial native T2 (n = 60), myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (n = 32), or pericardial enhancement (n = 22).

32293910,False,"Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,,,,,,True,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected health and economy worldwide on an unprecedented scale. Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S-spike protein. The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor for internalization, aided by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVID-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. Virus-induced angiotensin converting enzyme 2 downregulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heighten angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyperstimulated macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation and balanced immune response. Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as elderly adults and those with cardiovascular risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis-like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multiorgan failure and death. In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, in particular, in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as interleukin-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration, and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery. Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, and thrombosis remain important. Specific evidence-based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated.

Guidance is therefore needed regarding use of agents with potential activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pediatrics. A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 18 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of best available evidence and expert opinion. Given the typically mild course of pediatric COVID-19, supportive care alone is suggested for the overwhelming majority of cases. The panel suggests a decision-making framework for antiviral therapy that weighs risks and benefits based on disease severity as indicated by respiratory support needs, with consideration on a case-by-case basis of potential pediatric risk factors for disease progression. If an antiviral is used, the panel suggests remdesivir as the preferred agent. Hydroxychloroquine could be considered for patients who are not candidates for remdesivir or when remdesivir is not available. Antivirals should preferably be used as part of a clinical trial if available. Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of pediatric patients. For those rare cases of severe or critical disease, this guidance offers an approach for decision-making regarding antivirals, informed by available data.

Although the majority of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multiorgan involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials.

In reported cases, patients with myocarditis invariably presented with chest pain, usually 2 to 3 days after a second dose of mRNA vaccination, and had elevated cardiac troponin levels. ECG was abnormal with ST elevations in most, and cardiac MRI was suggestive of myocarditis in all tested patients. There was no evidence of acute COVID-19 or other viral infections. In 1 case, a cardiomyopathy gene panel was negative, but autoantibody levels against certain self-antigens and frequency of natural killer cells were increased. Although the mechanisms for development of myocarditis are not clear, molecular mimicry between the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and self-antigens, trigger of preexisting dysregulated immune pathways in certain individuals, immune response to mRNA, and activation of immunologic pathways, and dysregulated cytokine expression have been proposed. The reasons for male predominance in myocarditis cases are unknown, but possible explanations relate to sex hormone differences in immune response and myocarditis, and also underdiagnosis of cardiac disease in women. Almost all patients had resolution of symptoms and signs and improvement in diagnostic markers and imaging with or without treatment. Despite rare cases of myocarditis, the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favorable balance for all age and sex groups; therefore, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ≥12 years of age.",success

In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: limiting contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures and reducing the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. Given the current shortages of medical masks, we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory particles become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask wearing by infectious people (""source control"") with benefits at the population level, rather than only mask wearing by susceptible people, such as health care workers, with focus on individual outcomes. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.",success

Remarkably, in vivo, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damage were observed in mice coinfected with IAV. Moreover, such enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was not observed with several other respiratory viruses, likely due to a unique feature of IAV to elevate ACE2 expression.

Further, microvascular thrombosis has recently been demonstrated in patients with COVID-19, and has been proposed to mediate the pathogenesis of organ injury in this disease. In many of these conditions, microvascular thrombosis is accompanied by inflammation, an association referred to as thromboinflammation. In this review, we discuss endogenous regulatory mechanisms that prevent thrombosis in the microcirculation, experimental approaches to induce microvascular thrombi, and clinical conditions associated with microvascular thrombosis.

A decrease of the creatinine clearance associated with remdesivir has been inconstantly reported in clinical trials with unclear relevance. Despite these uncertainties, we searched for a potential signal of acute renal failure (ARF) in pharmacovigilance postmarketing data. An analysis of the international pharmacovigilance postmarketing databases (VigiBase) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was performed, using two disproportionality methods. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) compared the number of ARF cases reported with remdesivir, with those reported with other drugs prescribed in comparable situations of COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and lopinavir/ritonavir). The combination of the terms ""acute renal failure"" and ""remdesivir"" yielded a statistically significant disproportionality signal with 138 observed cases instead of the 9 expected. ROR of ARF with remdesivir was 20-fold (20.3; confidence interval 0.95 [15.7-26.3], P < 0.0001]) that of comparative drugs.

Therefore, we analyzed all Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) collected in the EudraVigilance database focusing on cardiac adverse events. From April to December 2020, 1375 ICSRs related to remdesivir were retrieved from EudraVigilance, of which 863 (62.8%) were related to male and (43.3%) adult patients. A total of 82.2% of all AEs (N = 2604) was serious and one third of the total ICSRs (N = 416, 30.3%) had a fatal outcome. The most frequently reported events referred to hepatic/hepatobiliary disorders (19.4%,), renal and urinary disorders (11.1%) and cardiac events (8.4%). Among 221 cardiac ICSRs, 69 reported fatal outcomes. Other drugs for cardiovascular disorders were reported as suspected/concomitant together with remdesivir in 166 ICSRs (75.1%), 62 of which were fatal. Moreover, the mean time to overall cardiac event was 3.3 days (±2.2). Finally, disproportionality analysis showed a two-fold increased risk of reporting a cardiac adverse event associated with remdesivir compared to both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. This study showed that remdesivir could be associated to risk of cardiac events, suggesting a potential safety signal which has not been completely evaluated yet.

We examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from Covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A(H1N1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. The lungs were studied with the use of seven-color immunohistochemical analysis, micro-computed tomographic imaging, scanning electron microscopy, corrosion casting, and direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression. In patients who died from Covid-19-associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration. The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P<0.001). In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth - predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis - was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P<0.001).

The National Institutes of Health has noted that PASC is a multi-organ disorder ranging from mild symptoms to an incapacitating state that can last for weeks or longer following recovery from initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed as the culprit for the development of PASC. These include, but are not limited to, direct or indirect invasion of the virus into the brain, immune dysregulation, hormonal disturbances, elevated cytokine levels due to immune reaction leading to chronic inflammation, direct tissue damage to other organs, and persistent low-grade infection. A multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of neuro-PASC will be required to diagnose and address these symptoms. Tailored rehabilitation and novel cognitive therapy protocols are as important as pharmacological treatments to treat neuro-PASC effectively. With recognizing the growing numbers of COVID-19 patients suffering from neuro-PASC, there is an urgent need to identify affected individuals early to provide the most appropriate and efficient treatments.

However, clinician perception of prognosis may influence treatment decisions and adversely affect outcome. On acute CT, the conspicuity of ICH compared with AIS may lead clinicians to overestimate severity and influence prognostic evaluation. We investigated whether clinicians' estimates of volume, severity, and prognosis from acute imaging differed between ICH and AIS. Methods- CT scans from participants with acute ICH or ischemic stroke were reviewed. Volume was calculated using the ABC/2 method and automated volumetric analysis via specialized imaging software. ICH cases were matched with AIS cases for lesion volume, based on acute (<6 hours) CT for ICH, and 24-hour CT for AIS. Blind to clinical information, clinicians estimated lesion volume to the nearest 5 mL, graded lesion severity from 1 (mild) to 5 (very severe), and estimated 30-day prognosis using the modified Rankin Scale. Results- We compared 33 ICH cases with 33 volume-matched AIS cases. Clinicians overestimated ICH volume and underestimated AIS volumes: mean differences (estimated-actual volume) were +8 mL (±30) for ICH and -8 mL (±27) for AIS ( P<0.001). Observers rated ICH to be of greater severity and poorer prognosis compared with AIS cases: 109 of 265 (41%) ICH cases rated severity categories 4 or 5 compared with 36 of 257 (14%) AIS, P<0.001; estimated modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 in 125 of 265 (47%) ICH compared with 190 of 257 (74%) AIS, P<0.001.

However, observational evidence indicating the benefits of angioplasty in the selected high-risk patients with ARAS has been increasing. Thus, the timely correction of stenosis through angioplasty may have a beneficial effect in selected patients. However, optimal patient selection for angioplasty has been debated and can be challenging at times. Clinicians must identify the responsive patients who would benefit from angioplasty through risk stratification and the prediction of outcomes. Efforts have been made for the determination of predictors that can identify the subgroups of patients who would benefit from angioplasty. Lower age, more severe stenosis, preserved renal perfusion, and absence of diabetes or generalized atherosclerosis have been reported as the predictors for the improvement of hypertension after angioplasty. Global renal ischemia, rapidly declining renal function over 6-12 months, progressive shrinkage of the affected kidney, lower resistive index, and lower levels of albuminuria have been reported as predictors of improved or preserved renal function after angioplasty.

In this respect the hypertension in these animals resembles the hypertension which is associated with so called benign nephrosclerosis in man. Subsequent increase of the constriction of the main renal arteries does not materially damage renal function, probably because of adequate development of accessory circulation. More delicate methods for detecting a change may yet prove that some damage does occur. Almost complete constriction of both main renal arteries, from the beginning, results in great elevation of systolic blood pressure which is accompanied by severe disturbance of renal function and uremia. This resembles the type of hypertension which is associated with so called malignant nephrosclerosis, in the sense of Fahr (17). In several of the animals with persistent elevation of systolic blood pressure, anatomical changes were observed in the glomeruli, vessels and parenchyma of the kidneys which are most probably directly referable to the ischemia.

Changes in fractional hypoxia after furosemide were also absent in the lowest sGFR stratum. These data demonstrate relative stability of renal oxygenation with moderate reductions in RBF and GFR but identify a transition to overt hypoxia and inflammatory cytokine release with severely reduced GFR.

All significant renal artery stenoses (greater than 50% luminal narrowing) were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgery. Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed if there was a blood pressure response to interventional therapy, according to the criteria established by the Cooperative Study of Renovascular Hypertension. Of the total group evaluated, 24% (39 of 167) had renal artery stenosis and 14% (23 of 167) had renovascular hypertension. Renal artery stenosis or occlusion was found in 27% (26 of 97) of whites and 19% (13 of 67) of blacks (p = 0.27). Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed in 18% (17 of 97) of whites and 9% (6 of 67) of blacks evaluated (p = 0.25). Renovascular hypertension was associated with severe or refractory hypertension and with smoking, but there were no racial differences in these associations. Blacks with renovascular hypertension tended to have low captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity. We conclude that blacks with clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension should be evaluated with angiography. Captopril-stimulated plasma renin may not be useful in detecting blacks with renovascular hypertension, but this and other potential screening tests require further evaluation.",success

Renal vein neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and plasma renin activity were measured. Total GFR did not change over 3 months in either group, but the stenotic kidney (STK) GFR rose over time in the stent compared with the medical group (+2.2[-1.8 to 10.5] versus -5.3[-7.3 to -0.3] ml/min; P=0.03). Contralateral kidney (CLK) GFR declined in the stent group (43.6±19.7 to 36.6±19.5 ml/min; P=0.03). Fractional tissue hypoxia fell in the STK (fraction R(2)* >30/s: 22.1%±20% versus 14.9%±18.3%; P<0.01) after stenting. Renal vein biomarkers correlated with the degree of hypoxia in the STK: NGAL(r=0.3; P=0.01) and MCP-1(r=0.3; P=0.02; more so after stenting). Renal vein NGAL was inversely related to renal blood flow in the STK (r=-0.65; P<0.001). Biomarkers were highly correlated between STK and CLK, NGAL (r=0.94; P<0.001), and MCP-1 (r=0.96; P<0.001). These results showed changes over time in single-kidney GFR that were not evident in parameters of total GFR. Furthermore, they delineate the relationship of measurable tissue hypoxia within the STK and markers of inflammation in human ARAS. Renal vein NGAL and MCP-1 indicated persistent interactions between the ischemic kidney and both CLK and systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines.",success

""Responders"" were those patients with an improvement of at least 20% in eGFR over baseline; all others were categorized as ""nonresponders."" Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify predictors of long-term survival. The median age of the cohort was 66 years (interquartile range [IQR], 60-73).

Once antihypertensive medication adherence is confirmed and out-of-office BP recordings exclude a white-coat effect, evaluation includes identification of contributing lifestyle issues, detection of drugs interfering with antihypertensive medication effectiveness, screening for secondary hypertension, and assessment of target organ damage. Management of RH includes maximization of lifestyle interventions, use of long-acting thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone or indapamide), addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and, if BP remains elevated, stepwise addition of antihypertensive drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to lower BP. If BP remains uncontrolled, referral to a hypertension specialist is advised.",success

Patients were followed up for the development of resistant hypertension based on AHA criteria of uncontrolled blood pressure despite use of ≥3 antihypertensive medications, with data collected on prescription filling information and blood pressure measurement. We determined incident cardiovascular events (death or incident myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or chronic kidney disease) in patients with and without resistant hypertension with adjustment for patient and clinical characteristics. Among 205 750 patients with incident hypertension, 1.9% developed resistant hypertension within a median of 1.5 years from initial treatment (0.7 cases per 100 person-years of follow-up). These patients were more often men, were older, and had higher rates of diabetes mellitus than nonresistant patients. Over 3.8 years of median follow-up, cardiovascular event rates were significantly higher in those with resistant hypertension (unadjusted 18.0% versus 13.5%, P<0.001). After adjustment for patient and clinical characteristics, resistant hypertension was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.33-1.62).

18391085,False,Journal Article;Practice Guideline,,,,,,,,True,"Resistant hypertension is a common clinical problem faced by both primary care clinicians and specialists. While the exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is unknown, clinical trials suggest that it is not rare, involving perhaps 20% to 30% of study participants. As older age and obesity are 2 of the strongest risk factors for uncontrolled hypertension, the incidence of resistant hypertension will likely increase as the population becomes more elderly and heavier. The prognosis of resistant hypertension is unknown, but cardiovascular risk is undoubtedly increased as patients often have a history of long-standing, severe hypertension complicated by multiple other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. The diagnosis of resistant hypertension requires use of good blood pressure technique to confirm persistently elevated blood pressure levels. Pseudoresistance, including lack of blood pressure control secondary to poor medication adherence or white coat hypertension, must be excluded. Resistant hypertension is almost always multifactorial in etiology. Successful treatment requires identification and reversal of lifestyle factors contributing to treatment resistance; diagnosis and appropriate treatment of secondary causes of hypertension; and use of effective multidrug regimens. As a subgroup, patients with resistant hypertension have not been widely studied. Observational assessments have allowed for identification of demographic and lifestyle characteristics associated with resistant hypertension, and the role of secondary causes of hypertension in promoting treatment resistance is well documented; however, identification of broader mechanisms of treatment resistance is lacking. In particular, attempts to elucidate potential genetic causes of resistant hypertension have been limited. Recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of resistant hypertension remain largely empiric due to the lack of systematic assessments of 3 or 4 drug combinations. Studies of resistant hypertension are limited by the high cardiovascular risk of patients within this subgroup, which generally precludes safe withdrawal of medications; the presence of multiple disease processes (eg, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic disease) and their associated medical therapies, which confound interpretation of study results; and the difficulty in enrolling large numbers of study participants. Expanding our understanding of the causes of resistant hypertension and thereby potentially allowing for more effective prevention and/or treatment will be essential to improve the long-term clinical management of this disorder.",success

Its prevalence appears to be increasing in the aging population. How often it is the primary cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is not yet certain. Some studies suggest that 10%-40% of elderly hypertensive patients with newly documented ESRD and no demonstrable primary renal disease have significant renal artery stenosis (RAS). Atherosclerotic vascular occlusive disease of the renal arteries does progress, but current rates of progression and occlusion are lower than those reported a decade ago. Methods of identifying patients whose renal function is at true risk from vascular occlusive disease and determining who will benefit from intervention remain elusive. The presence of RAS in an azotemic patient can be assessed with noninvasive and risk-free radiologic techniques, including Duplex doppler velicometry and magnetic resonance angiography. Functional tests that predict the change in renal function after revascularization are not yet available. However, a renal length of greater than 7.5 cm in the absence of renal cysts and a short history of renal functional deterioration indicate a good prognosis. Patients with recent deterioration in renal function, those with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a single functioning kidney, those with flash pulmonary edema, advanced chronic renal failure, or ESRD (who have much to gain), those with reversible azotemia during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) therapy, and those whose conditions cannot be managed medically should be considered for revascularization. Results from recent controlled clinical trials of the response to percutaneous transluminal renal artery angioplasty (PTRA) and stenting indicate that improvement in blood pressure control or renal function is not a predictable outcome of renal revascularization. In azotemic groups, 25%-30% of patients achieve important recovery of renal function. Thus, significant progress has been made recently in determining whether RAS is a frequent, treatable cause of renal failure. The decision to recommend revascularization remains a difficult balance between the risks and expense of the procedure and the undoubted benefits that accrue if renal function is successfully stabilized.",success

The PCC was visualized using multidetector computed tomography and defined relative to segmental arteries in patients with essential hypertension. PCC number before and 3 months after treatment was correlated with various renal parameters. Thirty-four stenotic kidneys from 30 patients were analyzed. PCC number correlated inversely with kidney volume. ARVD-stenotic kidneys with baseline PCC (collateral ARVD [C-ARVD], n=13) associated with elevated 24-hour urine protein and stenotic kidney vein level of tumor necrosis factor-α, lower single-kidney volume and blood flow, and greater hypoxia than in stenotic kidneys with no PCC (no collateral ARVD [NC-ARVD], n=17). Revascularization (but not medical-therapy alone) improved stenotic kidney function and reduced inflammation in both NC-ARVD and C-ARVD. In C-ARVD, revascularization also increased stenotic kidney volume, blood flow, and oxygenation to levels comparable to NC-ARVD, and induced PCC regression. However, revascularization improved systolic blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and filtration fraction only in NC-ARVD. Therefore, patients with C-ARVD have greater kidney dysfunction, atrophy, hypoxia, and inflammation compared with patients with NC-ARVD, suggesting that PCC does not effectively protect the stenotic kidney in ARVD. Renal artery revascularization improved in C-ARVD stenotic kidney function, but not hypertension or renin-angiotensin system activation.

RVH was diagnosed retrospectively on the basis of reduction in blood pressure after correction of ischaemia at follow-up. Renal vein renin measurements were used to calculate the ratios: Visch/Vctl (renal vein renin ratio; RVRR); Vctl/Viivc; (Visch - Viivc)/Viivc; (Vctl - Viivc)/Viivc, where Visch and Vctl indicate plasma renin activity (PRA) in the ischaemic and contralateral renal veins, respectively, and Viivc denotes PRA in the infrarenal inferior vena cava. A receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the cut-off value of renal vein renin measurement indexes that provided the best discrimination between patients with and without RVH and to identify patients with RVH caused by total occlusion of the renal artery. Sixty-seven patients were diagnosed as having RVH: 51 had significant renal artery stenoses (RVH non-occluded) and 16 had total renal artery occlusion (RVH occluded). Of the remaining 85 patients in whom RVH was excluded (non-RVH group), 27 had reno-parenchymal hypertension and 58 had essential hypertension. Of the renal vein renin measurement indexes, only RVRR and (Visch - Viivc)/Viivc in RVH-occluded patients differed significantly (P < 0.005) from those in the non-RVH group and showed the best performance by ROC curve analysis. This analysis also showed that, at any cut-off value, RVRR was far more accurate for identification of RVH-occluded patients than for identification of RVH non-occluded patients, both in the subgroup with unilateral and, even more so, in those with bilateral renal artery lesions. The best trade-off between sensitivity and false-positive rate was provided by cut-off values of 1.55 and 1.70 of the RVRR for identification of non-occluded and occluded RVH, respectively. RVRR is more useful for establishing an indication for nephrectomy in patients with renal artery occlusion than for identifying those patients with renal artery stenosis who will benefit from revascularization. In patients with RVH with bilateral renal artery lesions, lateralization of renin secretion occurs only in the presence of total renal artery occlusion.

A preinterventional work-up and a re-evaluation of the patients after one year was designed for the assessment of the clinical, functional and technical outcome. Successful technical dilatation was achieved in 97% of procedures with FMD patients and in 82% of procedures with AVD patients. A beneficial effect on the blood pressure and the renal function was registered in both groups. The overall cure and improvement rate for hypertension was 86% in the FMD group and 64% in the AVD group after one year's follow-up. A significant gain in the total renal function was registered in both groups, the average increase in glomerular filtration rate being 13% (P < 0.001) for the FMD group and 11% (P < 0.001) for the AVD group one year after PTRA. Renal function was improved or unchanged in 89% of FMD patients and 74% of AVD patients. The improvement in renal function was made by the revascularized kidney. Renal vein renin investigation predicted the clinical outcome with an excellent diagnostic accuracy as no renin negative patient became normotensive, and renin positive patients, who did not turn normotensive, were in almost 90% of the cases affected by technical failure or restenosis/contralateral stenosis. Thus, the sensitivity of renal vein renin investigation was 95% and the specificity 75%. The outcome for patients with hypertension and renal insufficiency was considerably poorer than for the whole group of patients, with only a 20% success rate for hypertension, but 50% in this group had increased or unchanged GFR after intervention.

We conclude that the RVRS demands a very restrictive referral pattern if it should be of prognostic value for the blood pressure outcome after intervention.

Data on patient comorbidities, procedure indication, lesion location, serum creatinine level, and procedure-related complications were analyzed. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess the association of continuous risk factors with complications, and the chi(2) test was used to assess the association of categoric risk factors with outcomes. The technical success rate for PTRS was 98%. Major complications included renal infarction in five patients (2.8%), permanently increased serum creatinine level in 10 patients (5.6%) that required hemodialysis in five (2.8%), blood transfusion in four patients (2.2%), surgical intervention for procedure-related complications in two patients (1.1%), and deep vein thrombosis in one patient (0.6%). Overall, major complications occurred in 15 procedures (8.4%). Death within 30 days after PTRS occurred in two patients (1.1%), but neither death was definitively caused by the procedure. No risk factors were found to be significantly (P <.05) associated with major complications.

Although PAI has been the subject of prior single-society papers, this is the first multisocietal effort on the topic. To initiate the AUC process, patient scenarios that are common in clinical practice were drafted, along with assumptions and definitions for those scenarios. The scenarios were created using published guidelines, trial data, and expert opinions from within the field of peripheral artery disease. The writing group developed 45 clinical scenarios with up to 6 intervention options per scenario and categorized them into 6 general sections. A separate, independent rating panel evaluated each indication using a scoring scale from 1 to 9, thereby designating each indication as “Appropriate” (score of 7 to 9), “May Be Appropriate” (score of 4 to 6), or “Rarely Appropriate” (score of 1 to 3). Throughout the scenarios, emphasis was placed on adhering to and exhausting medical therapy to achieve maximal benefit in those situations in which symptom management was desired or incidental disease was discovered. However, situations arise in which medical therapy is insufficient, and identifying a suitable revascularization strategy is necessary. After considering factors such as symptom burden, anatomic distribution, and ischemic burden, the rating panel determined that both endovascular and surgical approaches are Appropriate in clinical scenarios involving concomitant tissue loss or end organ compromise. There was a tendency to select endovascular approaches in these scenarios, particularly in anatomic distributions below the knee and where prior endovascular or surgical revascularization has been performed. Given the dynamic landscape of cardiovascular medicine, the writing group felt it was necessary to address situations in which adjunct arterial revascularization may be necessary to facilitate other procedures such as percutaneous valve replacement or hemodynamic support. The clinical situations where this occurs often make endovascular interventions more attractive and that was reflected in the ratings. The purpose of this particular AUC is to provide guidance to clinicians who may refer patients for revascularization treatments and to interventionalists and surgeons themselves. With the field of peripheral artery disease constantly evolving, it is imperative to offer tools and resources that physicians can utilize to provide the best care for their patients.",success

Primary surgical interventions (342) included main renal artery (136) and segmental renal artery (10) aortic reimplantation, renal artery bypass (55), segmental renal artery embolization (10), renal artery patch angioplasty (8), resection with reanastomosis (4), and partial or total nephrectomy (25). Non-renal artery procedures included patch aortoplasty (32), aortoaortic bypass (32), and splanchnic arterial revascularization (30). Nine patients required reoperation in the early postoperative period. During a mean follow-up of 49 months, secondary interventions were required in 35 children (21%), including both open surgical (37) and endovascular (14) interventions. Remedial intervention to preserve primary renal artery patency or a nephrectomy if such was impossible was required in 22 children (13%). The remaining secondary procedures were performed to treat previously untreated disease that became clinically evident during follow-up. Age at operation and abdominal aortic coarctation were independent predictors for reoperation. The overall experience revealed hypertension to be cured in 74 children (44%), improved in 78 (46%), and unchanged in 17 (10%). Children undergoing remedial operations were less likely (33%) to be cured of hypertension. There was no perioperative death or renal insufficiency requiring dialysis after either primary or secondary interventions. Contemporary surgical treatment of pediatric RVH provides a sustainable overall benefit to 90% of children. Interventions in the very young (<3 years) and concurrent abdominal aortic coarctation increase the likelihood of reoperation. Patients undergoing remedial surgery after earlier operative failures are less likely to be cured of hypertension. Judicious postoperative surveillance is imperative in children surgically treated for RVH.",success

Early and late blood pressure responses were adjusted for gender, age, and height. RA repair was evaluated by angiography, renal duplex sonography (RDS) scanning, or both. Primary patency and survival were estimated by product-limit methods. Thirty-four RAs among 32 kidneys were repaired. Bilateral renal RA disease to a solitary kidney was present in nine patients. RA lesions included dysplasia (44%), RA hypoplasia (20%), midaortic syndrome (12%), RA aneurysm (12%), dissection (8%), and arteritis (4%). All patients had severe hypertension (>95 th percentile systolic or diastolic pressure adjusted for gender, age, and height). RA repair comprised 25 bypasses (73%) consisting of 28% saphenous vein, 60% hypogastric artery, and 12% polytetrafluoroethylene; 2 patch angioplasties (6%), and 7 reimplantations (21%). Branch RA exposure was required in 28 kidneys (88%), and branch reconstruction was required in 61%. Warm in situ repair was used in 53%, in situ cold perfusion in 24%, and ex vivo cold perfusion in 23%. Of six bilateral RA repairs, one was staged and two patients are awaiting a staged repair. Combined aortic reconstruction was required in three patients. No unplanned nephrectomy was performed. There were no perioperative deaths. Hypertension was cured in 36%, improved in 56%, and failed in 8% at mean follow-up of 46.4 +/- 7.8 months. The mean calculated glomerular filtration rate increased from 82.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 preoperatively to 98.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 postoperatively. The postoperative patency of 30 RA reconstructions was evaluated by angiography, RDS scanning, or both. At mean follow-up of 32.8 months (median, 21.2 months), primary RA patency was 91%. No failures were observed after 2 months follow-up. Estimated survival was 100% at 60 months, with one death 9 years after surgery. Renovascular hypertension in children and adolescents was caused by a heterogeneous group of lesions. All patients had RA repair, with arterial autografts in most of the RA bypasses. Cold perfusion preservation was used in half of the complex branch RA repairs. These strategies provided 91% primary patency at mean follow-up of 32.8 months, with beneficial blood pressure response in 92%.

8028093,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Among various surgical techniques for renal artery reconstruction (RAR), anatomic aortorenal bypass has been the preferred standard. Yet concern regarding origin of the bypass from a diseased aorta and desire to avoid a major aortic operation in these patients who are often at poor risk has led to increasing use of extraanatomic bypass grafting, particularly hepatorenal and splenorenal bypass. This study was conducted to compare the safety and long-term performance of these different techniques of renal artery reconstruction. We reviewed a 15-year (1976 to 1991) experience with 323 surgical RAR performed in 285 patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease. Long-term patency and survival rates were analyzed by life-table methods. Variables potentially affecting early failure of the RAR and perioperative and late mortality rates were examined by Cox proportional hazards models. Diffuse atherosclerosis characterized the patients' clinical profile. Clinically evident coronary artery disease was present in 54% of patients, and some degree of renal insufficiency was present in 60%. Ninety-five percent of patients had hypertension with poor control of hypertension seen in 50%. Aortic disease necessitated combined aortic grafting and RAR in 43% of the study group. Various techniques of RAR were used as follows: endarterectomy or patch angioplasty, 8.5%; extraanatomic bypass grafting, 37% (hepatorenal, 62; splenorenal, 52; iliorenal, 7); and aortorenal bypass grafting, 54% (native aorta, 34; combined aortic graft and RAR, 140). Early failure of the RAR occurred in 5% of cases, and the operative mortality rate for the entire cohort was 5.6%. Median follow-up duration was 9.4 years. A comparison of early and late patency for the major types of RAR revealed equivalent (p = 0.44) performance of aortorenal and extraanatomic bypass grafting. Perioperative complications occurred more frequently (p < 0.02) in patients undergoing combined operations. The cumulative 5-year survival rate for all patients was 75%. Because extraanatomic bypass grafting can provide long-term results equivalent to aortorenal bypass grafting, the choice among techniques for RAR in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis should be based on both technical and operative safety considerations, rather than adherence to aortorenal bypass grafting as an inherently superior technique.",success

Seventy-seven patients (62 women, 15 men; mean age, 44 +/- 17 years) had branch RA reconstruction using ex vivo or in situ cold perfusion protection for 78 kidneys. Demographic data and surgical technique were examined. Blood pressure response and renal function were estimated. Patency of repair was determined by angiography and renal duplex ultrasound (RDUS) imaging. Primary RA patency was estimated by life-table methods. Seventy-eight RAs were repaired using ex vivo (49 kidneys) or in situ (29 kidneys) cold perfusion protection. Bilateral RA repair was performed in eight patients, with 13 repairs to solitary kidneys. RA disease included aneurysm (RAA) in 50, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in 37, atherosclerosis in 5, and arteritis in 2; 16 patients had both FMD and RAA. Hypertension was present in 93.5% (mean blood pressure, 184 +/- 35/107 +/- 19 mm Hg; mean of 1.9 +/- 1.1 drugs). RA repair included bypass using saphenous vein in 69, hypogastric artery in 3, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 2, composite vein/PTFE in 2, cephalic vein in 1, or aneurysmorrhaphy in 1. The eight bilateral RA repairs were staged. One patient required bilateral cold perfusion protection. One planned nephrectomy was performed at the time of contralateral ex vivo reconstruction. No primary nephrectomies were required for intended reconstruction. Each RA reconstruction required branch dissection and reconstruction (mean of 2.8 +/- 1.6 branches were repaired). Mean cold ischemia time was 125 +/- 40 minutes. Each kidney was reconstructed in an orthotopic fashion. Five early failures of repair required three nephrectomies and one operative revision. Based on postoperative angiography or RDUS, or both, primary patency of RA repair at 12 months was 85% +/- 5%; assisted primary patency was 93% +/- 4%. Among patients with preoperative hypertension, 15% were cured, 65% were improved, and 20% were considered failed. Early renal function was improved in 35%, unchanged in 48%, and worse in 17%.

Preservation fluids limit tissue damage during the ischemic period, but there is little information on the influence of preservation fluids on the physiologic consequences of warm ischemia alone, or on the comparative ability of such preservation fluids to limit warm ischemic injury. In this study, warm ischemia was induced in rat kidneys by crossclamping the left renal pedicle for 45 min with contralateral nephrectomy. The ischemic kidneys were flushed with Euro-Collins (EC), hyper osmolar citrate (HOC), University of Wisconsin (UW), or phosphate buffered sucrose (PBS)140 solution. Over a period of 2 h after reperfusion, urine and blood samples were collected and physiological parameters related to the function of the postischemic kidneys were assessed. The data show that postischemic renal function can be influenced by the choice of preservation fluid. Essentially, the continued use of EC as a renal preservation solution finds little support in these data, and, while HOC and UW solutions were better able to limit the decline in renal function after warm ischemia than EC, the solution most able to limit functional impairment after warm ischemia was PBS140. This analysis compares the efficacies of the commonly used preservation solutions and could form the basis for future solid-organ transplant studies that may ultimately allow us to propose best-practice guidelines and an optimum platform for improved preservation solutions.",success

We did a systematic review to identify all studies published up to March, 2018, in any language, that reported the relation between BCPR and the survival of OHCAs. Using standard forms, two authors independently identified studies for inclusion and extracted information. The outcome was survival. Meta-regression was done to ascertain weighted factors for the outcomes. Data were extracted from 19 studies involving 232,703 patients. Firstly, pooled odds ratio (OR) from 16 cohort studies showed that BCPR was associated with improved chance of survival of OHCAs compared with NO-BCPR (OR 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.66-2.30).

We performed descriptive statistics followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses. A total of 1132 persons (47%) completed the questionnaire. Only 13% of the subjects were willing to attempt bystander CPR for their families and friends, and 7% were willing to attempt bystander CPR for strangers. Willingness to attempt CPR was independently associated with office workers or skilled workers [odds ratio (OR) 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-2.7], having trained in CPR [OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 2.1-4.6], actual experience with CPR [OR: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.7-8.3], and having friends with heart diseases [OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.05-3.0]. Having trained in CPR was independently associated with younger age [OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.1], office workers or skilled workers [OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0], having driver's license [OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.4] and awareness of AED placement in a public space [OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.4-3.1]. Experience of CPR training closely associated with willingness to attempt CPR, and awareness of AED in a public space are significant factors in CPR training.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the barriers, facilitators and public attitudes to administering bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) which could inform future policy and initiatives to improve the rate of bystander CPR. Data was collected via a cross-sectional general population survey of 1027 adults in Scotland. 52% of respondents had been trained in CPR. Of those who were not trained, two fifths (42%) expressed a willingness to receive CPR training. Fewer than half (49%) felt confident administering CPR, rising to 82% if they were talked through it by a call handler. Multivariate analyses identified that people in social grade C2DE were less likely than those in social grade ABC1 to be CPR trained and less confident to administer CPR if talked through by a call handler. The older a person was, the less likely they were to be CPR trained, show willingness to be CPR trained or be confident to administer bystander CPR with or without instruction from an emergency call handler. These findings are particularly relevant considering that most OHCA happen in the homes of older people. In a developed country such as Scotland with widely available CPR training, only half of the adult population reported feeling confident about administering bystander CPR. Further efforts tailored specifically for people who are older, unemployed and have a lower social grade are required to increase knowledge, confidence and uptake of training in bystander CPR.",success

The chance of survival is increased significantly by lay rescuer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrival. It is well known that for bystanders, reasons for not providing CPR when witnessing an OHCA incident may be fear and the feeling of being exposed to risk. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of why barriers to providing CPR are overcome. Using a semi-structured interview guide, 10 lay rescuers were interviewed after participating in eight OHCA incidents. Qualitative content analysis was used. The lay rescuers were questioned about their CPR-knowledge, expectations, and reactions to the EMS and from others involved in the OHCA incident. They also were questioned about attitudes towards providing CPR in an OHCA incident in different contexts. The lay rescuers reported that they were prepared to provide CPR to anybody, anywhere. Comprehending the severity in the OHCA incident, both trained and untrained lay rescuers provided CPR. They considered CPR provision to be the expected behavior of any community citizen and the EMS to act professionally and urgently. However, when asked to imagine an OHCA in an unclear setting, they revealed hesitation about providing CPR because of risk to their own safety. Mutual trust between community citizens and towards social institutions may be reasons for overcoming barriers in providing CPR by lay rescuers. A normative obligation to act, regardless of CPR training and, importantly, without facing any adverse legal reactions, also seems to be an important factor behind CPR provision.

In an effort to promote bystander CPR, the procedure has been streamlined, and ultrashort teaching modalities have been introduced. CPR has been increasingly reconceptualized as simple, safe, and easy to perform; however, current methods of CPR instruction may not adequately prepare lay rescuers for the various logistical, conceptual, and emotional challenges of resuscitating a victim of cardiac arrest. We adopted a constructivist grounded theory methodology to qualitatively explore bystander CPR and invited lay rescuers who had recently (ie, within 1 week) intervened in an OHCA to participate in semistructured interviews and focus groups. We used constant comparative analysis until theoretical saturation to derive a midrange explanatory theory of bystander CPR. We constructed a 3-stage theoretical model describing a common experiential process for lay rescuer intervention in OHCA: Being called to act is disturbing, causing panic, shock, and disbelief that must ultimately be overcome. Taking action to save the victim is complicated by several misconceptions about cardiac arrest, where victims are mistakenly believed to be choking, and agonal respirations are misinterpreted to mean the victim is alive. Making sense of the experience is challenging, at least in the short term, where lay rescuers have to contend with self-doubt, unanswered questions, and uncomfortable emotional reactions to a traumatic event. Our study suggests that current CPR training programs may not adequately prepare lay rescuers for the reality of an OHCA and identifies several key knowledge gaps that should be addressed.

The study was conducted in the Stavanger region of Norway, an area with very high bystander CPR rates. Three themes emerged from the interview analysis: concern, uncertainty and coping strategies. Providing CPR had been emotionally challenging for all lay rescuers and, for some, had consequences in terms of family and work life. Several lay rescuers experienced persistent mental recurrences of the OHCA incident and had concerns about the outcome for the cardiac arrest victim. Unknown or fatal outcomes often caused feelings of guilt and were particularly difficult to handle. Several reported the need to be acknowledged for their CPR attempts. Health-educated lay rescuers seemed to be less affected than others. A common coping strategy was confiding in close relations, preferably the health educated. However, some required professional help to cope with the OHCA incident. Lay rescuers experience emotional and social challenges, and some struggle to cope in life after providing CPR in OHCA incidents. Experiencing a positive patient outcome and being a health-educated lay rescuer seem to mitigate concerns. Common coping strategies are attempts to reduce uncertainty towards patient outcome and own CPR quality.

Willingness to act and practical CPR skills were assessed, directly after training and at 6 months, by using a questionnaire and a PC Skill Reporting System. Data on CPR skills were registered in a modified version of the Cardiff test, where scores were given in 12 different categories, adding up to a total score of 12-48 points. Training and measurements were performed from December 2013 to October 2014. 63 classes or 1232 seventh grade students (13-year-old) were included in the study.

Hence, this study was conducted with an aim to assess the efficacy of video-based training in comparison to the traditional instructor-based CPR training in layman. This prospective cross-over observational study included 109 undergraduate university students attending voluntary resuscitation training and were randomly divided into two groups of video-based demonstration (VBD) and instructor-based demonstration (IBD) of compression only life support (COLS). They were then assessed for psychomotor skill development (Laerdal Simpad Plus Q-CPR) and perception about the quality of training methodology as primary and secondary objectives, respectively.

Our main aim was to assess the feasibility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training in high school students by using avatars in MMVM. We also analyzed experiences, self-efficacy, and concentration in response to training. In this prospective international collaborative study, an e-learning method was used with high school students in Sweden and the United States. A software game platform was modified for use as a serious game to train in emergency medical situations. Using MMVW technology, participants in teams of 3 were engaged in virtual-world scenarios to learn how to treat victims suffering cardiac arrest. Short debriefings were carried out after each scenario. A total of 36 high school students (Sweden, n=12; United States, n=24) participated. Their self-efficacy and concentration (task motivation) were assessed. An exit questionnaire was used to solicit experiences and attitudes toward this type of training. Among the Swedish students, a follow-up was carried out after 6 months. Depending on the distributions, t tests or Mann-Whitney tests were used. Correlation between variables was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation. Regression analyses were used for time-dependent variables. The participants enjoyed the training and reported a self-perceived benefit as a consequence of training. The mean rating for self-efficacy increased from 5.8/7 (SD 0.72) to 6.5/7 (SD 0.57, P<.001).

In addition to prior hands-on CPR training, the following were described as facilitators: prior knowledge that intervention is crucial in improving survival, cannot cause substantial harm, and that the AED will provide guidance through CPR; prior hands-on training in AED use; during CPR performance, teamwork (ie, support), using the AED voice prompt and a ventilation mask, as well as demonstrating leadership and feeling a moral obligation to act. Several factors other than previous hands-on CPR training facilitate lay bystander instigation of CPR and AED use. The recognition and modification of these factors may increase lay bystander CPR rates and patient survival following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.",success

About 2% of high school students, 3% of teachers, 26% of emergency medical technicians, 3% of medical nurses and 16% of medical students claimed they would 'definitely' perform MMV plus CC on a stranger. However, 21-72% claimed they would prefer the alternative of performing CC alone. Respondents claimed their unwillingness to perform MMV is not due to the fear of contracting a communicable disease, but the lack of confidence in their ability to perform CPR properly. in all categories of respondents, willingness to perform MMV plus CC for a stranger was disappointingly low. Better training in MMV together with teaching awareness that CC alone can be given should be instituted to maximize the number of potential providers of CPR in the community, even in communities where the incidence of HIV is very low.",success

Among the non-trained, 51% never thought about the need to attend training. Knowledge of CPR is generally poor. About 52% wish to learn CPR, 79% and 91% are willing to attempt CPR on a stranger or a loved one, respectively. Lack of knowledge is the strongest barrier to attempt CPR. People aged ≥60, those with educational level lower than high school, widowed and retired are mostly untrained and unwilling to learn CPR. Females and unemployed are mostly untrained, but willing to be educated. There is a need for increasing CPR training and retraining, and improving awareness and motivation to learn CPR in the Crimean population, targeting the least trained groups.

To investigate both this and the use of self-efficacy in self-assessment we investigated the relationship between self-efficacy and measured performance during a simulated resuscitation, and the effect of death of a simulated patient on self-efficacy. Consultant and trainee paediatricians and anaesthesiologists scored their self-efficacy for paediatric resuscitation skills before taking an unannounced simulated resuscitation test and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE)-tests of chest compressions and bag- and mask-ventilation. Performance in the simulation was scored by three independent expert observers and the OSCE's using a modified Berden and ventilation penalty scores. Self-efficacy for the relevant skill was significantly higher in doctors choosing to give chest compressions, to intubate or insert an intraosseous device and in those who decided to intubate early. Self-efficacy correlated moderately with the quality of global performance on the simulation but not with the OSCE scores, nor was quality of individual skills during the simulation related to self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was higher in doctors who had taken the Advanced Paediatric Life Support (APLS)-course. Death of the simulated patient had a negative effect on self-efficacy. Self-efficacy seems to be predictive of certain actions during a simulated resuscitation but does not correlate with quality of performance of resuscitation skills. Self-efficacy might therefore be useful as a predictor of the application of learning, but cannot be recommended for self-assessment.

Although pathogens can be isolated from the saliva of infected persons, salivary transmission of bloodborne viruses is unusual and transmission of infection has been rare: Only 15 documented cases have been reported. Most of these cases involved a bacterial pathogen, such as Neisseria meningitidis. Transmission of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or cytomegalovirus during CPR has not been reported; all three reported cases of HIV infection acquired during resuscitation of an infected patient resulted from high-risk cutaneous exposures. There have been no reports of infection acquired during CPR training. Simple infection-control measures, including use of barrier devices, can reduce the risk for acquisition of an infectious disease during CPR and CPR training. Postexposure protocols can further protect potential rescuers and trainees.

This review of the legal literature seeks to quantify the number of cases brought against bystanders in the US over the past 30 years and explore the reasons behind them. The Westlaw legal research database was searched for jury verdicts, settlements, and appellate opinions from all 50 states from 1989 to 2019 for personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits involving CPR. Of 506 cases manually reviewed by the authors, 170 were directly related to CPR. Case details including jurisdiction, location, date, plaintiff and defendant demographics, level of training of CPR provider, relationship to patient, motivation for the lawsuit, and case outcomes were recorded. Our data show a significant difference in the number of cases of cases alleging battery versus negligence regarding provision of CPR. Of 170 cases, 167 were due to inadequate or untimely bystander CPR. Three cases alleging harm due to providing CPR were identified. This study represents the largest single study of legal cases involving bystander CPR in the medical literature.

Subjects were dichotomized as to whether or not they were physically present during the patient's resuscitation. A structured interview obtained the patient's prearrest functioning, whether the family member witnessed or performed CPR, patient and family demographic data, key cardiac arrest events, and a measure of subject PTSD symptoms (PTSD Symptom Scale-Interview [PSS-I]). There were 34 witnesses and 20 nonwitnesses. Each group was similar in race, religion, age, gender, and relationship to the patient. Patients in each group were similar in prearrest functioning. Witnesses' total PTSD symptom scores were nearly two times higher than nonwitnesses (14.47 vs. 7.60, respectively; mean difference = 6.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57 to 13.17). Two PSS-I subscales were higher for witnesses than nonwitnesses: Avoidance (5.41 vs. 2.25; mean difference = 3.16, 95% CI = 0.74 to 5.58) and Increased Arousal (4.26 vs. 2.20; mean difference = 2.06, 95% CI = 0.08 to 4.05), while Reexperiencing was not (4.79 vs. 3.15; mean difference = 1.64, 95% CI = -0.62 to 3.91). Linear regression analysis indicated that witnessing CPR of a loved one was associated with a mean increase of nearly 12 points on the PSS-I after controlling for the possibility of other potentially influential events and characteristics. Results were similar when CPR providers (n = 6) were removed from the witness group. Witnessing a failed CPR attempt of a loved one in an out-of-hospital location may be associated with displaying symptoms of PTSD in the early term of the bereavement period.

Data were collected from an electronic medical record serving an academic general medicine practice in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Using propensity scores to minimize bias, we matched a cohort of 1,340 users of NSAIDs with 1,340 users of acetaminophen. Propensity score models included covariates likely to affect blood pressure or the use of NSAIDs. The study outcomes were the mean systolic blood pressure measurement after starting NSAIDs and changes in antihypertensive therapy.

Evidence increasingly shows that these conditions are interlinked through common risk factors, coincident in an ageing population, and are connected biologically through some deleterious effects of anticancer treatment on CV health. Anticancer therapies can cause a wide spectrum of short- and long-term cardiotoxic effects. An explosion of novel cancer therapies has revolutionised this field and dramatically altered cancer prognosis. Nevertheless, these new therapies have introduced unexpected CV complications beyond heart failure. Common CV toxicities related to cancer therapy are defined, along with suggested strategies for prevention, detection and treatment. This ESMO consensus article proposes to define CV toxicities related to cancer or its therapies and provide guidance regarding prevention, screening, monitoring and treatment of CV toxicity. The majority of anticancer therapies are associated with some CV toxicity, ranging from asymptomatic and transient to more clinically significant and long-lasting cardiac events. It is critical however, that concerns about potential CV damage resulting from anticancer therapies should be weighed against the potential benefits of cancer therapy, including benefits in overall survival. CV disease in patients with cancer is complex and treatment needs to be individualised. The scope of cardio-oncology is wide and includes prevention, detection, monitoring and treatment of CV toxicity related to cancer therapy, and also ensuring the safe development of future novel cancer treatments that minimise the impact on CV health. It is anticipated that the management strategies discussed herein will be suitable for the majority of patients.

Eighteen patients (15%) developed grade 1 or 2 TMC during follow-up. No significant difference was observed for age, cardiovascular risk factors, fasting blood glucose level, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, baseline LVEF, PER, and PFR between patients with and without TMC. In contrast, patients with TMC showed a longer TPFR at baseline (median [Q1-Q3]: 165 ms [149-190] vs. 142 ms [130-162]; P < 0.001). Furthermore, by logistic regression analysis, baseline TPFR >180 ms and the cumulative dose of epirubicin remained independent predictors of TMC. Patients receiving 600 mg/m(2) of epirubicin before trastuzumab showed a higher incidence of TMC (35%) than did both patients who previously received 300 mg/m(2) of epirubicin (13%) and those who received only docetaxel associated with trastuzumab (9%).

Preclinical studies have confirmed that dexrazoxane has significant activity as a cardioprotective agent against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Dexrazoxane is well-tolerated, with myelosuppression being the dose-limiting toxicity in Phase I trials. The cardioprotective utility of dexrazoxane has been further illustrated in a number of randomized trials. In addition no significant difference in survival has been observed between the dexrazoxane and control arms of these trials but, in one, a significantly lower response rate was observed in the dexrazoxane compared to placebo arm. Further trials are required to evaluate the efficacy of dexrazoxane in hematological malignancies as well as the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.

Existing English language systematic analyses and guidelines were considered. The mechanisms of CAC are multifaceted, but various cardioprotective therapies target many of these pathways. To date, anthracyclines and HER-2 targeted therapies have been the focus of cardioprotective trials to date as they are the most commonly implicated therapies in CAC. While traditional neurohormonal antagonists (ACEIs, ARBs, and beta blockers) and DEX performed favorably in many small clinical trials, the quality of available evidence remains limited. Hence, major guidelines lack consensus on an approach to primary prevention of CAC. Given the uncertain role of preventive therapy, monitoring for a symptomatic or asymptomatic decline in LV function is imperative with prompt evaluation should this occur. Numerous ongoing randomized controlled trials seek to either confirm the findings of these previous studies or identify new therapeutic agents to prevent CAC. Clinical implications are derived from the available literature as well as current guideline recommendations for CAC cardioprotection. At this time, no single therapy has a clear cardioprotective benefit in preventing CAC nor is any therapy strongly recommended by current guidelines.

Further, in some nations, cancer has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of mortality. Identification of molecular mechanisms by which cancerous cells evade T cell-mediated cytotoxic damage has led to the modern era of immunotherapy in cancer treatment. Agents that release these immune brakes have shown activity to recover dysfunctional T cells and regress various cancer. Both cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) play their role as physiologic brakes on unrestrained cytotoxic T effector function. CTLA-4 (CD 152) is a B7/CD28 family; it mediates immunosuppression by indirectly diminishing signaling through the co-stimulatory receptor CD28. Ipilimumab is the first and only FDA-approved CTLA-4 inhibitor; PD-1 is an inhibitory transmembrane protein expressed on T cells, B cells, Natural Killer cells (NKs), and Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs). Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed on the surface of multiple tissue types, including many tumor cells and hematopoietic cells. PD-L2 is more restricted to hematopoietic cells. Blockade of the PD-1 /PDL-1 pathway can enhance anti-tumor T cell reactivity and promotes immune control over the cancerous cells. Since the FDA approval of ipilimumab (human IgG1 k anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody) in 2011, six more immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been approved for cancer therapy. PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab and PD-L1 inhibitors atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab are in the current list of the approved agents in addition to ipilimumab.

Thrombin generation was measured in defibrinated plasma exposed to chemotherapy-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

The effects of chemotherapy drugs on phosphatidylserine exposure and the protein C pathway were also measured. Exposure of defibrinated plasma to either doxorubicin- or epirubicin-treated HUVECs resulted in an increase in plasma thrombin generation. The procoagulant activity of doxorubicin- and epirubicin-treated HUVECs reflects an increase in tissue factor activity and phosphatidylserine exposure. Doxorubicin-mediated increase in tissue factor activity is related to increased levels of phosphatidylserine rather than to protein disulfide isomerase activity, and is likely to involve reactive oxygen species generation. Unlike doxorubicin, epirubicin does not have an impact on the protein C anticoagulant pathway. Interestingly, neither methotrextate nor 5-fluorouracil altered endothelial or monocyte hemostatic properties.

Btk in platelets mediates platelet activation via glycoprotein (GP) VI, which is crucial for atherosclerotic plaque-induced platelet thrombus formation. This can be selectively inhibited by Btk inhibitors. Since patients on second-generation Btk inhibitors apparently show less bleeding than patients on ibrutinib, we compared the effects of ibrutinib and four novel irreversible Btk inhibitors on GPVI-dependent platelet aggregation in blood and in vitro bleeding time. Low concentrations of collagen which induced the same low degree of GPVI-mediated platelet aggregation as atherosclerotic plaque material were applied. IC<sub>50</sub> values for collagen (0.2-0.5 µg/mL)-induced platelet aggregation after 15-minute pre-incubation were: ibrutinib 0.12 µM, BGB-3111 0.51 µM, acalabrutinib 1.21 µM, ONO/GS-4059 1.20 µM and evobrutinib 5.84 µM. Peak venous plasma concentrations of ibrutinib (0.5 µM), acalabrutinib (2 µM) and ONO/GS-4059 (2 µM) measured after anti-proliferative dosage inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation, but did not increase PFA-200 closure time on collagen/epinephrine. Closure times were moderately increased by 2- to 2.5-fold higher concentrations of these inhibitors, but not by BGB-3111 (1 µM) and evobrutinib (10 µM). Prolonging platelet drug exposure to 60 minutes lowered IC<sub>50</sub> values of any Btk inhibitor for GPVI-mediated aggregation by several fold, and 5- to 10-fold below anti-proliferative therapeutic drug plasma levels.

The purpose of this study was to better understand the safety profile of anticoagulants in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors, with particular interest in the safety and efficacy of DOACs. Our hypothesis was that DOACs are as safe and effective as LWMH in this population. This study was conducted through a single-center retrospective chart review of 125 patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors on anticoagulation. Our primary outcomes were major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), with secondary outcomes of minor bleeding and recurrent thrombosis. The rate of major bleeding was 26% in the LMWH group versus 9.6% in the DOAC group (p = .03). The rate of ICH was 15% in the LMWH group versus 5.8% in the DOAC group (p = .09). The severity of ICH in both groups was low with median Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 scores of 2 in the LMWH group and 3 in the DOAC group.

In Hokusai-VTE Cancer, edoxaban was noninferior to dalteparin for the composite of recurrent VTE and major bleeding (12.8% versus 13.5%), with numerically lower recurrent VTE (7.9% versus 11.3%) and significantly higher major bleeding (6.9% versus 4.0%); only patients with gastrointestinal cancer had significantly higher risk of bleeding with edoxaban. In SELECT-D, rivaroxaban had numerically lower VTE recurrence (4% versus 11%), comparable major bleeding (6% versus 4%), and numerically higher clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (13% versus 4%) versus dalteparin. Most bleeding events were gastrointestinal or urologic; patients with esophageal/gastroesophageal cancer had higher rates of major bleeding with rivaroxaban (36% versus 11%). For comparison of apixaban versus dalteparin, CARAVAGGIO is ongoing, and preliminary results from ADAM VTE are favorable. This review concludes that DOACs appear to be reasonable alternatives to LMWH for treatment of cancer-associated VTE. In patients with gastrointestinal cancer, DOAC use should be considered on a case-by-case basis with consideration of the relative risks and benefits.",success

Due to their novelty, pharmacokinetic DOAC drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that result in clinical adverse events have not been well-documented. This study aims to systematically review reported pharmacokinetic DDIs resulting in clinical adverse events through documented observational evidence to better inform clinicians in clinical practice. A comprehensive literature review of EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Ovid HealthStar was conducted through March 10th, 2020. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from eligible articles according to pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles reporting bleeding or thrombotic outcomes in non-controlled (observational) settings resulting from suggested pharmacokinetic DOAC DDIs were included. A total of 5567 citations were reviewed, of which 24 were included following data extraction. The majority were case reports (n = 21) documenting a single adverse event resulting from a suspected DOAC DDI, while the remaining papers were a case series (n = 1) and cohort studies (n = 2). The most commonly reported interacting drugs were amiodarone and ritonavir (bleeding), and phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine (thrombosis). Bleeding events more often resulted from a combined mechanism (P-glycoprotein AND CYP3A4 inhibition), whereas thrombotic events resulted from either combined OR single P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 induction. Current literature evaluating the real-world risk of DOAC DDIs is limited to few case reports and retrospective observational analyses.

Arrhythmias were reported as a side effect of many chemotherapeutic drugs. Anthracyclines are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) at a rate of 2-10%, but rarely with ventricular tachycardia (VT)/fibrillation. Taxol and other antimicrotubular drugs are safe in terms of pro-arrhythmic side effects and do not cause any consistent rhythm abnormalities. Arrhythmias induced by 5-fluorouracil, including VT, are mostly ischaemic in origin and usually occur in the context of coronary spasm produced by this drug. Cisplatin-particularly with intrapericardial use-is associated with a very high rate of AF (12-32%). Melphalan is associated with AF in 7-12% of cases, but it does not appear to cause VT. Interleukin-2 is linked to frequent arrhythmia, mostly AF. We summarized the available data on chemotherapy-induced arrhythmia, particularly AF and VT.

Despite these improvements, there is increasing recognition that many cancer patients or cancer survivors can develop cardiovascular diseases, either due to the cancer itself or as a result of anticancer therapy. Much attention has focused on heart failure; however, other cardiotoxicities, notably cardiac rhythm disorders, can occur without underlying cardiomyopathy. Supraventricular tachycardias occur in cancer patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (anthracyclines, gemcitabine, cisplatin and alkylating-agents) or kinase-inhibitors (KIs) such as ibrutinib. Ventricular arrhythmias, with a subset of them being torsades-de-pointes (TdP) favored by QTc prolongation have been reported: this may be the result of direct hERG-channel inhibition or a more recently-described mechanism of phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibition. The major anticancer drugs responsible for QTc prolongation in this context are KIs, arsenic trioxide, anthracyclines, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Anticancer drug-induced cardiac rhythm disorders remain an underappreciated complication even by experienced clinicians. Moreover, the causal relationship of a particular anticancer drug with cardiac arrhythmia occurrence remains challenging due in part to patient comorbidities and complex treatment regimens. For example, any cancer patient may also be diagnosed with common diseases such as hypertension, diabetes or heart failure which increase an individual's arrhythmia susceptibility. Further, anticancer drugs are generally usually used in combination, increasing the challenge around establishing causation. Thus, arrhythmias appear to be an underappreciated adverse effect of anticancer agents and the incidence, significance and underlying mechanisms are now being investigated.",success
