Transthoracic echocardiography is the principal method currently used for assessing cardiac structure and function; however, standard echocardiographic techniques are relatively insensitive to early or subtle changes in cardiac performance, particularly in mice. To develop and validate an echocardiographic strain imaging methodology for sensitive and rapid cardiac phenotyping in small animal models. Herein, we describe a modified echocardiographic technique that uses speckle-tracking based strain analysis for the noninvasive evaluation of cardiac performance in adult mice. This method is found to be rapid, reproducible, and highly sensitive in assessing both regional and global left ventricular (LV) function. Compared with conventional echocardiographic measures of LV structure and function, peak longitudinal strain and strain rate were able to detect changes in adult mouse hearts at an earlier time point following myocardial infarction and predicted the later development of adverse LV remodeling. Moreover, speckle-tracking based strain analysis was able to clearly identify subtle improvement in LV function that occurred early in response to standard post-myocardial infarction cardiac therapy. Our results highlight the utility of speckle-tracking based strain imaging for detecting discrete functional alterations in mouse models of cardiovascular disease in an efficient and comprehensive manner. Echocardiography speckle-tracking based strain analysis represents a method for relatively high-throughput and sensitive cardiac phenotyping, particularly in evaluating emerging cardiac agents and therapies in mice.",success

In contrast, mitochondria from these tissues in young mice and humans are primed for apoptosis, predisposing them to undergo cell death in response to genotoxic damage. While expression of the apoptotic protein machinery is nearly absent by adulthood, in young tissues its expression is driven by c-Myc, linking developmental growth to cell death.

These unbiased studies revealed profound repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha and beta (PGC-1α and PGC-1β, also known as Ppargc1a and Ppargc1b, respectively) and the downstream network in mice null for either telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) or telomerase RNA component (Terc) genes. Consistent with PGCs as master regulators of mitochondrial physiology and metabolism, telomere dysfunction is associated with impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and function, decreased gluconeogenesis, cardiomyopathy, and increased reactive oxygen species. In the setting of telomere dysfunction, enforced Tert or PGC-1α expression or germline deletion of p53 (also known as Trp53) substantially restores PGC network expression, mitochondrial respiration, cardiac function and gluconeogenesis. We demonstrate that telomere dysfunction activates p53 which in turn binds and represses PGC-1α and PGC-1β promoters, thereby forging a direct link between telomere and mitochondrial biology.

Given this, we first established a model that provokes modest and progressive cardiotoxicity without constitutional symptoms, reminiscent of the effects seen in patients.

To test the functional relevance of doxorubicin-triggered autolysosome accumulation, we studied animals with diminished autophagic activity resulting from haploinsufficiency for Beclin 1.

Whereas hibernating cardiomyocytes represent the critical reserve of dysfunctional cells that can be potentially rescued, a lack of a suitable animal model has hampered insights on this medically important condition. We developed a transgenic mouse system for conditional induction of long-term hibernation and a system to rescue hibernating cardiomyocytes at will. Via myocardium-specific induction (and, in turn, deinduction) of a VEGF-sequestering soluble receptor, we show that VEGF is indispensable for adjusting the coronary vasculature to match increased oxygen consumption and exploit this finding to generate a hypoperfused heart. Importantly, ensuing ischemia is tunable to a level at which large cohorts of cardiomyocytes are driven to enter a hibernation mode, without cardiac cell death. Relieving the VEGF blockade even months later resulted in rapid revascularization and full recovery of contractile function. Furthermore, we show that left ventricular remodeling associated with hibernation is also fully reversible. The unique opportunity to uncouple hibernation from other ischemic heart phenotypes (e.g., infarction) was used to determine the genetic program of hibernation; uncovering hypoxia-inducible factor target genes associated with metabolic adjustments and induced expression of several cardioprotective genes. Autophagy, specifically self-digestion of mitochondria, was identified as a key prosurvival mechanism in hibernating cardiomyocytes. This system may lend itself for examining the potential utility of treatments to rescue dysfunctional cardiomyocytes and reverse maladaptive remodeling.",success

Cardiac arrhythmias caused by drug-induced long QT syndrome are thought to result mainly from reductions in the delayed rectifier potassium ion (K(+)) current I(Kr). Here, we report a mechanism for drug-induced QT prolongation that involves changes in multiple ion currents caused by a decrease in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Treatment of canine cardiac myocytes with inhibitors of tyrosine kinases or PI3Ks caused an increase in action potential duration that was reversed by intracellular infusion of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. The inhibitors decreased the delayed rectifier K(+) currents I(Kr) and I(Ks), the L-type calcium ion (Ca(2+)) current I(Ca,L), and the peak sodium ion (Na(+)) current I(Na) and increased the persistent Na(+) current I(NaP). Computer modeling of the canine ventricular action potential showed that the drug-induced change in any one current accounted for less than 50% of the increase in action potential duration. Mouse hearts lacking the PI3K p110α catalytic subunit exhibited a prolonged action potential and QT interval that were at least partly a result of an increase in I(NaP).

Recent approvals of several anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) drugs for lung cancer treatment prompted ongoing clinical trials that directly combine PD-1 inhibitors with thoracic radiotherapy for locally advanced lung cancer. Overlapping toxicities from either modality have the potential to increase the risk for radiation-induced cardiotoxicity (RICT), which is well documented among patients with Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer. To investigate cardiotoxicity without the compounding pulmonary toxicity from thoracic radiotherapy, we developed a technique to deliver cardiac irradiation (CIR) in a mouse model concurrently with PD-1 blockade to determine the presence of cardiac toxicity by using physiological testing and mortality as end points along with histological analysis. We observed an acute mortality of 30% within 2 weeks after CIR plus anti-PD-1 antibody compared with 0% from CIR plus immunoglobulin G (p = 0.023). Physiological testing demonstrated a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.01) by echocardiogram. Tissue analyses revealed increased immune cell infiltrates within cardiac tissue. Depletion of CD8-positive lymphocytes with anti-CD8 antibody reversed the acute mortality, suggesting that the toxicity is CD8-positive cell-mediated. To validate these findings using a clinically relevant fractionated radiotherapy regimen, we repeated the study by delivering five daily fractions of 6 Gy. Similar mortality, cardiac dysfunction, and histological changes were observed in mice receiving fractionated radiotherapy with concurrent anti-PD-1 therapy. This study provides strong preclinical evidence that radiation-induced cardiotoxicity is modulated by the PD-1 axis and that PD-1 blockade should be administered with careful radiotherapy planning with an effort of reducing cardiac dose.",success

We previously found preliminary evidence for an association between CHIP and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the nature of this association was unclear. We used whole-exome sequencing to detect the presence of CHIP in peripheral-blood cells and associated such presence with coronary heart disease using samples from four case-control studies that together enrolled 4726 participants with coronary heart disease and 3529 controls. To assess causality, we perturbed the function of Tet2, the second most commonly mutated gene linked to clonal hematopoiesis, in the hematopoietic cells of atherosclerosis-prone mice. In nested case-control analyses from two prospective cohorts, carriers of CHIP had a risk of coronary heart disease that was 1.9 times as great as in noncarriers (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 2.7). In two retrospective case-control cohorts for the evaluation of early-onset myocardial infarction, participants with CHIP had a risk of myocardial infarction that was 4.0 times as great as in noncarriers (95% CI, 2.4 to 6.7). Mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, and JAK2 were each individually associated with coronary heart disease. CHIP carriers with these mutations also had increased coronary-artery calcification, a marker of coronary atherosclerosis burden. Hypercholesterolemia-prone mice that were engrafted with bone marrow obtained from homozygous or heterozygous Tet2 knockout mice had larger atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root and aorta than did mice that had received control bone marrow. Analyses of macrophages from Tet2 knockout mice showed elevated expression of several chemokine and cytokine genes that contribute to atherosclerosis.

Our aim was to investigate whether a causal relationship exists between HF and the development of cancer. HF was induced by inflicting large anterior myocardial infarction in APC<sup>min</sup> mice, which are prone to developing precancerous intestinal tumors, and tumor growth was measured. In addition, to rule out hemodynamic impairment, a heterotopic heart transplantation model was used in which an infarcted or sham-operated heart was transplanted into a recipient mouse while the native heart was left in situ. After 6 weeks, tumor number, volume, and proliferation were quantified. Candidate secreted proteins were selected because they were previously associated both with (colon) tumor growth and with myocardial production in post-myocardial infarction proteomic studies. Myocardial gene expression levels of these selected candidates were analyzed, as well as their proliferative effects on HT-29 (colon cancer) cells. We validated these candidates by measuring them in plasma of healthy subjects and patients with HF. Finally, we associated the relation between cardiac specific and inflammatory biomarkers and new-onset cancer in a large, prospective general population cohort. The presence of failing hearts, both native and heterotopically transplanted, resulted in significantly increased intestinal tumor load of 2.4-fold in APC<sup>min</sup> mice (all P<0.0001). The severity of left ventricular dysfunction and fibrotic scar strongly correlated with tumor growth ( P=0.002 and P=0.016, respectively). We identified several proteins (including serpinA3 and A1, fibronectin, ceruloplasmin, and paraoxonase 1) that were elevated in human patients with chronic HF (n=101) compared with healthy subjects (n=180; P<0.001). Functionally, serpinA3 resulted in marked proliferation effects in human colon cancer (HT-29) cells, associated with Akt-S6 phosphorylation. Finally, elevated cardiac and inflammation biomarkers in apparently healthy humans (n=8319) were predictive of new-onset cancer (n=1124) independently of risk factors for cancer (age, smoking status, and body mass index). We demonstrate that the presence of HF is associated with enhanced tumor growth and that this is independent of hemodynamic impairment and could be caused by cardiac excreted factors.

Combining mathematical modeling and in vivo as well as ex vivo studies, we found that increased amounts of the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2-HG), produced by IDH2 mutant leukemic cells, cause contractile dysfunction in the heart. This contractile dysfunction is associated with impaired oxidative decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate, a redirection of Krebs cycle intermediates, and increased ATP citrate lyase (ACL) activity. Increased availability of D2-HG also leads to altered histone methylation and acetylation in the heart.

The AHA policy research department first identified current AHA policies specific to each CVH metric and CVD management indicator and the evidence underlying each policy. Writing group members then reviewed each policy and the related metrics and indicators. The results of each review were summarized, and topic-specific priorities and overarching themes for future policy research were proposed. There was generally close alignment between current AHA policies and the 2020 CVH metrics and CVD management indicators; however, certain specific policies still lack a robust evidence base. For CVH metrics, the distinction between policies for adults (age ≥20 years) and children (<20 years) was often not considered, although policy approaches may differ importantly by age. Inclusion of all those <20 years of age as a single group also ignores important differences in policy needs for infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. For CVD management indicators, specific quantitative targets analogous to criteria for ideal, intermediate, and poor CVH are lacking but needed to assess progress toward the 2020 goal to reduce deaths from CVDs and stroke. New research in support of current policies needs to focus on the evaluation of their translation and implementation through expanded application of implementation science. Focused basic, clinical, and population research is required to expand and strengthen the evidence base for the development of new policies. Evaluation of the impact of targeted improvements in population health through strengthened surveillance of CVD and stroke events, determination of the cost-effectiveness of policy interventions, and measurement of the extent to which vulnerable populations are reached must be assessed for all policies.

Some state legislatures are using preemption with increasing regularity to thwart local policies that have the potential to reduce health inequities. Despite recent trends, preemption is not inherently adversarial to public health, equity, or good governance but rather reflects its wielder's goals and values. Existing frameworks for assessing preemption fail to reconcile its potential to both advance and hinder health equity. An equity-first preemption framework can facilitate case-by-case assessments of whether preemption is likely to worsen inequities or whether it is an appropriate response to address existing inequities. Robust empirical evidence is needed to develop and operationalize such a framework. Due to the inequitable distribution of various social determinants of health, disparities in health and well-being are tied to where an individual lives. In the United States, a zip code often better predicts a person's health than their genetic code. As communities seek to redress these inequities, many find that, due to state preemption, their zip code also dictates their ability to pursue more equitable laws through local government action. Preemption is a legal doctrine whereby a higher level of government may limit or even eliminate the power of a lower level of government to regulate a certain issue. We conducted a literature review to survey existing scholarship about the effects of preemption on public health and health equity using online databases such as PubMed, WestLaw, and Google Scholar. We also cohosted a series of cross-sector, interdisciplinary research convenings with preemption, public health, and equity experts. Based on our findings, this article reviews the role of law and policy in the genesis of health inequities and highlights how preemption has both created and alleviated such inequities. We demonstrate how a normative framework rooted in redressing health inequities can advance a more just approach to preemption and outline a research agenda to support future action. Law and policy have been central to creating health inequities, and while those same tools can promote health equity, some state legislatures are using preemption with increasing regularity to thwart local policies that may improve health and equity. Nevertheless, preemption is not inherently adversarial to public health, equity, or good governance. Preemptive federal civil rights laws, for example, have countered government-sanctioned discrimination. However, existing frameworks for assessing preemption fail to reconcile its potential to both advance and hinder health equity. Shortcomings in existing preemption frameworks demonstrate the need for new approaches to elevate equity as a central consideration in assessing preemption. We propose the development of an equity-first preemption framework to establish evidence-based criteria for assessing when preemption will enhance or inhibit equity and a research agenda for developing the evidence necessary to inform and operationalize the framework. An equity-first reconceptualization of preemption can help ensure that local governments remain places of innovation while allowing states and the federal government to block local actions that are likely to create or perpetuate inequities.",success

Common determinants in the identified measures were organizational culture, implementation climate, and readiness for implementation, each aspects of the internal setting. Pragmatic quality ranged from adequate to good, with most measures freely available, brief, and at high school reading level. Few psychometric properties were reported. Well-tested quantitative measures of implementation internal settings were under-utilized in policy studies. Further development and testing of external context measures are warranted. This review is intended to stimulate measure development and high-quality assessment of health policy implementation outcomes and determinants to help practitioners and researchers spread evidence-informed policies to improve population health.

Models of sustainability have been evolving to reflect challenges in the fit between intervention and context. We examine the development of concepts of sustainability, and respond to two frequent assumptions -'voltage drop,' whereby interventions are expected to yield lower benefits as they move from efficacy to effectiveness to implementation and sustainability, and 'program drift,' whereby deviation from manualized protocols is assumed to decrease benefit. We posit that these assumptions limit opportunities to improve care, and instead argue for understanding the changing context of healthcare to continuously refine and improve interventions as they are sustained. Sustainability has evolved from being considered as the endgame of a translational research process to a suggested 'adaptation phase' that integrates and institutionalizes interventions within local organizational and cultural contexts. These recent approaches locate sustainability in the implementation phase of knowledge transfer, but still do not address intervention improvement as a central theme. We propose a Dynamic Sustainability Framework that involves: continued learning and problem solving, ongoing adaptation of interventions with a primary focus on fit between interventions and multi-level contexts, and expectations for ongoing improvement as opposed to diminishing outcomes over time. A Dynamic Sustainability Framework provides a foundation for research, policy and practice that supports development and testing of falsifiable hypotheses and continued learning to advance the implementation, transportability and impact of health services research.",success

It is reported to have an incidence of 0.05-7% of patients. Most are thrombotic in origin and are noted after discharge from the postanesthetic care unit. Common predisposing factors include age, a previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, and vascular and metabolic diseases. The mortality is more than two times greater than in strokes occurring outside the hospital. Delayed diagnosis and a synergistic interaction between the inflammatory changes normally associated with stroke, and those normally occurring after surgery, may explain this increase. Intraoperative hypotension is an infrequent direct cause of stroke. Hypotension will augment the injury produced by embolism or other causes, and this may be especially important in the postoperative period, during which monitoring is not nearly as attentive as in the operating room.

This relatively rare complication deserves attention because of its high mortality and serious disability, the latter of which can lead to prolonged hospital stay as well as discharge to long-term care facilities. The aim of this article was to review the literature on perioperative stroke in general surgery, excluding carotid and cardiac surgeries because these have already been thoroughly investigated in previous papers. A search strategy was designed to identify all relevant studies on perioperative stroke in the English language. This search was restricted to papers published up to December 5, 2011. Studies were initially identified from the Medline/PubMed database, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database using the search terms 'surgery', 'perioperative stroke', 'risk factors', 'anticoagulation treatment' and 'antiplatelet treatment'. The incidence of perioperative stroke among patients who undergo nonvascular surgery is reported to be about 0.08-0.7%. This depends on the type and complexity of the surgical procedure along with patient risk factors. The reported perioperative mortality is 18-26%. One of the main issues is the management of patients taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs, as the risk of bleeding has to be counterbalanced with the risk of arterial thrombosis due to discontinuation. Additionally, the presence of symptomatic carotid stenosis should be taken into account in the risk evaluation. To date, current guidelines are incomplete regarding the management of patients with vascular disease undergoing nonvascular surgery. It is recommended to stop oral anticoagulation approximately 5 days before major surgery to adequately allow the INR to normalize, and at the same time subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin or intravenous unfractionated heparin should be started. Regarding new anticoagulants, dabigatran does not need to be withheld for minor procedures. Currently, there are no clear recommendations on the use of rivaroxaban and apixaban. Data concerning the management of patients undergoing antiplatelet therapy are lacking. To date, neurologists discourage the perioperative withdrawal of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) especially in patients in secondary prevention. The 'Antiplatelet Agents in the Perioperative Management of Patients Trial' is ongoing to assess the safety and determine the optimal use of ASA in the perioperative management of patients undergoing general and abdominal surgery.

In the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substudy of ICSS (International Carotid Stenting Study), 231 patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomized to undergo CAS (n=124) or CEA (n=107). MRIs were performed 1 to 7 days before and 1 to 3 days after treatment. The primary outcome event was stroke or transient ischemic attack in any territory occurring between the post-treatment MRI and the end of follow-up. Time to occurrence of the primary outcome event was compared between patients with (DWI+) and without (DWI-) new DWI lesions on the post-treatment scan in the CAS and CEA groups separately. Median time of follow-up was 4.1 years (interquartile range: 3.0 to 5.2). In the CAS group, recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred more often among DWI+ patients (12 of 62) than among DWI- patients (6 of 62), with a cumulative 5-year incidence of 22.8% (standard error [SE]: 7.1%) and 8.8% (SE: 3.8%), respectively (unadjusted hazard ratio: 2.85; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 7.72; p=0.04). In DWI+ and DWI- patients, 8 and 2 events, respectively, occurred within 6 months after treatment. In the CEA group, there was no difference in recurrent cerebrovascular events between DWI+ and DWI- patients. Ischemic brain lesions discovered on DWI after CAS seem to be a marker of increased risk for recurrent cerebrovascular events. Patients with periprocedural DWI lesions might benefit from more aggressive and prolonged antiplatelet therapy after CAS.

Our final analysis included 42 studies with 49 separate intervention groups for a total of 2632 patients. The prevalence of SBI s following transcatheter aortic valve implantation was 0.71 (95% CI 0.64-0.77); following aortic valve replacement 0.44 (95% CI 0.31-0.57); in a mixed cardiothoracic surgery group 0.39 (95% CI 0.28-0.49); coronary artery bypass graft 0.25 (95% CI 0.15-0.35); percutaneous coronary intervention 0.14 (95% CI 0.10-0.19); and off-pump coronary artery bypass 0.14 (0.00-0.58). The risk ratio of focal neurologic deficits to SBI in aortic valve replacement was 0.22 (95% CI 0.15-0.32); in off-pump coronary artery bypass 0.21 (95% CI 0.02-2.04); with mixed cardiothoracic surgery 0.15 (95% CI 0.07-0.33); coronary artery bypass graft 0.10 (95% CI 0.05-0.18); transcatheter aortic valve implantation 0.10 (95% CI 0.07-0.14); and percutaneous coronary intervention 0.06 (95% CI 0.03-0.14).

Patients were prospectively followed for 30 days postoperatively for the primary outcome of stroke. Established cardiovascular and perioperative risk scores (CHADS<sub>2</sub>, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc, Revised Cardiac Risk Index, Mashour et al risk score, Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest risk score, and National Quality Improvement Project American College of Surgeons surgical risk calculator) were assessed to predict perioperative stroke. Results- Stroke occurred in the perioperative period of 1474 noncardiac surgeries (0.27%). Patients with perioperative stroke were older, more frequently male, had lower body mass index, and were more likely to have undergone vascular surgery or neurosurgery than patients without stroke (P<0.001 for each comparison). All risk prediction models were associated with increased risk of perioperative stroke (C statistic [AUC] range, 0.743-0.836).

In this review, we examine the significance, pathophysiology, risk factors, and evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and management of perioperative stroke. This is a narrative review based on literature from the PubMed database regarding perioperative stroke across a broad surgical population. The Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care recently published evidence-based recommendations for perioperative management of patients at high risk for stroke; these recommendations were analyzed and incorporated into this review. The incidence of overt perioperative stroke is highest in patients presenting for cardiac and major vascular surgery, although preliminary data suggest that the incidence of covert stroke may be as high as 10% in non-cardiac surgery patients. The pathophysiology of perioperative stroke involves different pathways. Thrombotic stroke can result from increased inflammation and hypercoagulability; cardioembolic stroke can result from disease states such as atrial fibrillation, and tissue hypoxia from anemia can result from the combination of anemia and beta-blockade. Across large-scale database studies, common risk factors for perioperative stroke include advanced age, history of cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and renal disease. Recommendations for prevention and management of perioperative stroke are evolving, though further work is needed to clarify the role of proposed modifiable risk factors such as perioperative anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, appropriate transfusion thresholds, and perioperative beta-blockade.

The CHADS( 2) was formed by assigning 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, and diabetes mellitus and by assigning 2 points for history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Data from peer review organizations representing 7 states were used to assemble a National Registry of AF (NRAF) consisting of 1733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 95 years who had nonrheumatic AF and were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge. Hospitalization for ischemic stroke, determined by Medicare claims data. During 2121 patient-years of follow-up, 94 patients were readmitted to the hospital for ischemic stroke (stroke rate, 4.4 per 100 patient-years). As indicated by a c statistic greater than 0.5, the 2 existing classification schemes predicted stroke better than chance: c of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.71) for the scheme developed by the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) and c of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.71-0.76) for the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) III scheme. However, with a c statistic of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80-0.84), the CHADS( 2) index was the most accurate predictor of stroke. The stroke rate per 100 patient-years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.7) for each 1-point increase in the CHADS( 2) score: 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2-3.0) for a score of 0; 2.8 (95% CI, 2.0-3.8) for 1; 4.0 (95% CI, 3.1-5.1) for 2; 5.9 (95% CI, 4.6-7.3) for 3; 8.5 (95% CI, 6.3-11.1) for 4; 12.5 (95% CI, 8.2-17.5) for 5; and 18.2 (95% CI, 10.5-27.4) for 6.

Thus, many potential risk factors have not been included. We refined the 2006 Birmingham/National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) stroke risk stratification schema into a risk factor-based approach by reclassifying and/or incorporating additional new risk factors where relevant. This schema was then compared with existing stroke risk stratification schema in a real-world cohort of patients with AF (n = 1,084) from the Euro Heart Survey for AF. Risk categorization differed widely between the different schemes compared. Patients classified as high risk ranged from 10.2% with the Framingham schema to 75.7% with the Birmingham 2009 schema. The classic CHADS(2) (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age > 75, Diabetes, prior Stroke/transient ischemic attack) schema categorized the largest proportion (61.9%) into the intermediate-risk strata, whereas the Birmingham 2009 schema classified 15.1% into this category. The Birmingham 2009 schema classified only 9.2% as low risk, whereas the Framingham scheme categorized 48.3% as low risk. Calculated C-statistics suggested modest predictive value of all schema for TE. The Birmingham 2009 schema fared marginally better (C-statistic, 0.606) than CHADS(2). However, those classified as low risk by the Birmingham 2009 and NICE schema were truly low risk with no TE events recorded, whereas TE events occurred in 1.4% of low-risk CHADS(2) subjects. When expressed as a scoring system, the Birmingham 2009 schema (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc acronym) showed an increase in TE rate with increasing scores (P value for trend = .003). Our novel, simple stroke risk stratification schema, based on a risk factor approach, provides some improvement in predictive value for TE over the CHADS(2) schema, with low event rates in low-risk subjects and the classification of only a small proportion of subjects into the intermediate-risk category. This schema could improve our approach to stroke risk stratification in patients with AF.",success

Baseline characteristics, operative data, and postoperative outcomes were compared in patients who developed stroke with those who did not. Previously recognized stroke risk factors, including AF, were analyzed along with the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc scores.

The aim of this study is to determine how often these three risk-prediction tools agree on the classification of patients as low risk (less than 1%) of major adverse cardiac event. This is a retrospective observational study using a sample of 10,000 patient records. The risk of cardiac complications was calculated for the Revised Cardiac Index and the Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest models using published coefficients, and for the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator using the publicly available website. The authors used the intraclass correlation coefficient and kappa analysis to quantify the degree of agreement between these three risk-prediction tools. There is good agreement between the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest estimates of major adverse cardiac events (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.70), while only poor agreement between (1) American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Surgical Risk Calculator and the Revised Cardiac Index (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.40), and (2) Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest and Revised Cardiac Index (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.30). The three prediction models disagreed 29% of the time on which patients were low risk. There is wide variability in the predicted risk of cardiac complications using different risk-prediction tools.

Reference sections of published randomized clinical trials and previously published reviews were searched for additional references. Intracranial atherosclerotic disease is a highly prevalent cause of stroke that is associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke. It is more prevalent among blacks, Hispanics, and Asians compared with whites. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and a sedentary lifestyle are the major modifiable risk factors associated with intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Randomized clinical trials comparing aggressive management (dual antiplatelet treatment for 90 days followed by aspirin monotherapy and intensive management of vascular risk factors) with intracranial stenting plus aggressive medical management have shown medical management alone to be safer and more effective for preventing stroke. As such, aggressive medical management has become the standard of care for symptomatic patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Nevertheless, there are subgroups of patients who are still at high risk of stroke despite being treated with aggressive medical management. Future research should aim to establish clinical, serological, and imaging biomarkers to identify high-risk patients, and clinical trials evaluating novel therapies should be focused on these patients.",success

A retrospective cohort study was conducted of adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass at a tertiary center between November 1, 2009, and March 31, 2015. The primary outcome was postoperative ischemic stroke. Intraoperative hypotension was defined as the number of minutes spent within mean arterial pressure bands of less than 55, 55 to 64, and 65 to 74 mmHg before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass. The association between stroke and hypotension was examined by using logistic regression with propensity score adjustment. Among the 7,457 patients included in this analysis, 111 (1.5%) had a confirmed postoperative diagnosis of stroke. Stroke was strongly associated with sustained mean arterial pressure of less than 64 mmHg during cardiopulmonary bypass (adjusted odds ratio 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.21 for every 10 min of mean arterial pressure between 55 and 64 mmHg; adjusted odds ratio 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.23 for every 10 min of mean arterial pressure less than 55 mmHg). Other factors that were independently associated with stroke were older age, hypertension, combined coronary artery bypass graft/valve surgery, emergent operative status, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass duration, and postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation. Hypotension is a potentially modifiable risk factor for perioperative stroke.

Reported strengths of associations from high-quality studies were classified into end-organ specific injury risks, such as acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, and stroke, and overall organ injury risks for various arterial blood pressure thresholds. We present an overview of 42 articles on reported associations between various absolute and relative intraoperative hypotension definitions and their associations with postoperative adverse outcomes after noncardiac surgery. Elevated risks of end-organ injury were reported for prolonged exposure (≥10 min) to mean arterial pressures <80 mm Hg and for shorter durations <70 mm Hg.

The meeting featured a modified Delphi process in which groups addressed various aspects of perioperative arterial pressure. Three consensus statements on intraoperative blood pressure were established. 1) Intraoperative mean arterial pressures below 60-70 mm Hg are associated with myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, and death. Injury is a function of hypotension severity and duration. 2) For adult non-cardiac surgical patients, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a general upper limit of arterial pressure at which therapy should be initiated, although pressures above 160 mm Hg have been associated with myocardial injury and infarction. 3) During cardiac surgery, intraoperative systolic arterial pressure above 140 mm Hg is associated with increased 30 day mortality.

Evidence for reductions in O2 content (CaO2 ) rather than arterial O2 tension (PaO2 ) as the chief regulator of cerebral vasodilation, with deoxyhemoglobin as the primary O2 sensor and upstream response effector, is discussed. We review in vitro and in vivo data to summarize the molecular mechanisms underpinning CBF responses during changes in CaO2 . We surmise that 1) during hypoxemic hypoxia in healthy humans (e.g., conditions of acute and chronic exposure to normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia), elevations in CBF compensate for reductions in CaO2 and thus maintain cerebral O2 delivery; 2) evidence from studies implementing iso- and hypervolumic hemodilution, anemia, and polycythemia indicate that CaO2 has an independent influence on CBF; however, the increase in CBF does not fully compensate for the lower CaO2 during hemodilution, and delivery is reduced; and 3) the mechanisms underpinning CBF regulation during changes in O2 content are multifactorial, involving deoxyhemoglobin-mediated release of nitric oxide metabolites and ATP, deoxyhemoglobin nitrite reductase activity, and the downstream interplay of several vasoactive factors including adenosine and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. The emerging picture supports the role of deoxyhemoglobin (associated with changes in CaO2 ) as the primary biological regulator of CBF. The mechanisms for vasodilation therefore appear more robust during hypoxemic hypoxia than during changes in CaO2 via hemodilution.

Better understanding the pathophysiology of WS infarcts would guide treatment. Two distinct hypotheses, namely low-flow and micro-embolism, are equally supported by neuropathological and physiological studies. Here we review the evidence regarding the mechanisms for WS stroke in carotid disease and whether they differ between cortical and internal WS infarcts. After a brief account of the anatomy of the WS and the cerebrovascular physiology in circumstances of low perfusion pressure, the literature concerning the mechanisms of WS infarction in carotid disease is reviewed and discussed with emphasis on imaging and ultrasound studies of the cerebral hemodynamics. The evidence strongly favors a hemodynamic mechanism for internal WS infarction, especially regarding the so-called rosary-like pattern in the centrum semiovale. However, the relationships between cortical WS infarction and hemodynamic compromise appear more complicated. Thus, although severe hemodynamic compromise appears to underlie combined cortical and internal WS infarction, artery-to-artery embolism may play an important role in isolated cortical WS infarcts. Based on the high prevalence of microembolic signals documented by ultrasound in symptomatic carotid disease, a recent hypothesis postulates that embolism and hypoperfusion play a synergetic role, according to which small embolic material prone to lodge in distal field arterioles would be more likely to result in cortical micro-infarcts when chronic hypoperfusion prevails.

The average value for Hct was significantly lower in women than in men. According to the mean value +/- 1 SD of Hct, the subjects were grouped into 3, in each sex as follows: low (less than 35%), normal (35-45%) and high (greater than or equal to 45%) for men, and, low (less than 30%), normal (30-40%) and high (greater than or equal to 40%) for women. During the follow-up period, cerebral infarction occurred in 117 patients. The cumulative incidence of cerebral infarction in the low Hct group for men was the lowest, even after adjustments for age and blood pressure. Conversely, the incidence in the low Hct group of women was significantly higher than that in the normal Hct group and was consistently increased with time during 2-5 years of the follow-up. After the 6th year or later, however, the incidence was gradually but significantly increased in the high Hct group, compared with the normal Hct group. Since Hct levels were related with other variables such as serum total cholesterol, serum total protein, Quetelet index and prevalence of hypertension in both sexes, heavy alcohol consumption in men, and glucose intolerance in women, such variables were taken into account using Cox's proportional hazards regression model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",success

Data on 13,716 participants in the prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study were analyzed to assess the joint effect of CKD and anemia on risk of incident stroke during a 9-year follow-up period. CKD was defined as a creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin levels of <13 g/dL for men or <12 g/dL for women. Overall, CKD was associated with an increase in stroke risk after adjustment for other factors [hazard ratio HR) 1.81; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.02]. However, this association was modified substantially by anemia. In the presence of anemia, CKD was associated with a substantially higher risk of stroke compared to no CKD (HR 5.43; 95% CI 2.04 to 14.41).

Infarcts of patients with newly observed anemia were twice as large as infarcts with normal hemoglobin levels. Anemia at hospital admission and any hemoglobin decrease during acute stroke treatment affect outcome negatively, probably by enlarging and accelerating infarct growth.

We enrolled 2016 patients who were 50 years of age or older, who had either a history of or risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and whose hemoglobin level was below 10 g per deciliter after hip-fracture surgery. We randomly assigned patients to a liberal transfusion strategy (a hemoglobin threshold of 10 g per deciliter) or a restrictive transfusion strategy (symptoms of anemia or at physician discretion for a hemoglobin level of <8 g per deciliter). The primary outcome was death or an inability to walk across a room without human assistance on 60-day follow-up. A median of 2 units of red cells were transfused in the liberal-strategy group and none in the restrictive-strategy group.

Compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy, a more liberal strategy could reduce cardiac complications by lowering myocardial damage, thereby reducing future deaths from cardiovascular disease. We aimed to establish the effect of a liberal transfusion strategy on long-term survival compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy. In the randomised controlled FOCUS trial, adult patients aged 50 years and older, with a history of or risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and with postoperative haemoglobin concentrations lower than 100 g/L within 3 days of surgery to repair a hip fracture, were eligible for enrolment. Patients were recruited from 47 participating hospitals in the USA and Canada, and eligible participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio by a central telephone system to either liberal transfusion in which they received blood transfusion to maintain haemoglobin level at 100 g/L or higher, or restrictive transfusion in which they received blood transfusion when haemoglobin level was lower than 80 g/L or if they had symptoms of anaemia. In this study, we analysed the long-term mortality of patients assigned to the two transfusion strategies, which was a secondary outcome of the FOCUS trial. Long-term mortality was established by linking the study participants to national death registries in the USA and Canada. Treatment assignment was not masked, but investigators who ascertained mortality and cause of death were masked to group assignment. Analyses were by intention to treat. The FOCUS trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00071032. Between July 19, 2004, and Feb 28, 2009, 2016 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: 1007 to the liberal transfusion strategy and 1009 to the restrictive transfusion strategy. The median duration of follow-up was 3·1 years (IQR 2·4-4·1 years), during which 841 (42%) patients died. Long-term mortality did not differ significantly between the liberal transfusion strategy (432 deaths) and the restrictive transfusion strategy (409 deaths) (hazard ratio 1·09 [95% CI 0·95-1·25]; p=0·21). Liberal blood transfusion did not affect mortality compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy in a high-risk group of elderly patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or risk factors. The underlying causes of death did not differ between the trial groups. These findings do not support hypotheses that blood transfusion leads to long-term immunosuppression that is severe enough to affect long-term mortality rate by more than 20-25% or cause of death.

To provide recommendations for the target hemoglobin level for RBC transfusion among hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable and the length of time RBCs should be stored prior to transfusion. Reference librarians conducted a literature search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion (1950-May 2016) and RBC storage duration (1948-May 2016) without language restrictions. The results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 31 RCTs included 12 587 participants and compared restrictive thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7-8 g/dL) with liberal thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 9-10 g/dL). The summary estimates across trials demonstrated that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds were not associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, rebleeding, pneumonia, or thromboembolism. For RBC storage duration, 13 RCTs included 5515 participants randomly allocated to receive fresher blood or standard-issue blood. These RCTs demonstrated that fresher blood did not improve clinical outcomes. It is good practice to consider the hemoglobin level, the overall clinical context, patient preferences, and alternative therapies when making transfusion decisions regarding an individual patient. Recommendation 1: a restrictive RBC transfusion threshold in which the transfusion is not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL is recommended for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients, rather than when the hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). A restrictive RBC transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL is recommended for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, and those with preexisting cardiovascular disease (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). The restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is likely comparable with 8 g/dL, but RCT evidence is not available for all patient categories. These recommendations do not apply to patients with acute coronary syndrome, severe thrombocytopenia (patients treated for hematological or oncological reasons who are at risk of bleeding), and chronic transfusion-dependent anemia (not recommended due to insufficient evidence). Recommendation 2: patients, including neonates, should receive RBC units selected at any point within their licensed dating period (standard issue) rather than limiting patients to transfusion of only fresh (storage length: <10 days) RBC units (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). Research in RBC transfusion medicine has significantly advanced the science in recent years and provides high-quality evidence to inform guidelines. A restrictive transfusion threshold is safe in most clinical settings and the current blood banking practices of using standard-issue blood should be continued.",success

Although anesthetics present pharmacologic properties consistent with preservation of brain viability in the context of an ischemic insult, no anesthetic has been proven efficacious for neuroprotection in humans. After such effort, it could be concluded that anesthetics are simply not neuroprotective in humans. Moreover, pharmacologic neuroprotection with non-anesthetic drugs has also repeatedly failed to be demonstrated in human acute brain injury. Recent focus has been on rectification of promising preclinical neuroprotection data and subsequent failed clinical trials. This has led to consensus guidelines for the process of transferring purported therapeutics from bench to bedside. In this review we first examined the history of anesthetic neuroprotection research. Then, a systematic review was performed to identify major clinical trials of anesthetic neuroprotection. Both the preclinical neuroprotection portfolio cited to justify a clinical trial and the design and conduct of that clinical trial were evaluated using modern standards that include the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. In publications intended to define anesthetic neuroprotection, we found overall poor quality of both preclinical efficacy analysis portfolios and clinical trial designs and conduct. Hence, using current translational research standards, it was not possible to conclude from existing data whether anesthetics ameliorate perioperative ischemic brain injury. Incorporation of advances in translational neuroprotection research conduct may provide a basis for more definitive and potentially successful clinical trials of anesthetics as neuroprotectants.",success

The objective of this workshop was to discuss and develop consensus solutions to improve patient management and outcomes and to discuss what older adults should be told (and by whom) about postoperative brain health risks. Thus, the workshop was provider and patient oriented as well as solution focused rather than etiology focused. For those areas in which we determined that there were limited evidence-based recommendations, we identified knowledge gaps and the types of scientific knowledge and investigations needed to direct future best practice. Because concerns about perioperative neurocognitive injury in pediatric patients are already being addressed by the SmartTots initiative, our workshop discussion (and thus this article) focuses specifically on perioperative cognition in older adults. The 2 main perioperative cognitive disorders that have been studied to date are postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Postoperative delirium is a syndrome of fluctuating changes in attention and level of consciousness that occurs in 20%-40% of patients >60 years of age after major surgery and inpatient hospitalization. Many older surgical patients also develop postoperative cognitive deficits that typically last for weeks to months, thus referred to as postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Because of the heterogeneity of different tools and thresholds used to assess and define these disorders at varying points in time after anesthesia and surgery, a recent article has proposed a new recommended nomenclature for these perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Our discussion about this topic was organized around 4 key issues: preprocedure consent, preoperative cognitive assessment, intraoperative management, and postoperative follow-up. These 4 issues also form the structure of this document. Multiple viewpoints were presented by participants and discussed at this in-person meeting, and the overall group consensus from these discussions was then drafted by a smaller writing group (the 6 primary authors of this article) into this manuscript. Of course, further studies have appeared since the workshop, which the writing group has incorporated where appropriate. All participants from this in-person meeting then had the opportunity to review, edit, and approve this final manuscript; 1 participant did not approve the final manuscript and asked for his/her name to be removed.",success

We included randomized trials comparing different methods of anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery in adults. The primary focus of this review was the comparison of regional anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia. The use of nerve blocks preoperatively or in conjunction with general anaesthesia is evaluated in another review. The main outcomes were mortality, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, acute confusional state, deep vein thrombosis and return of patient to their own home. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We analysed data with fixed-effect (I(2) < 25%) or random-effects models. We assessed the quality of the evidence according to the criteria developed by the GRADE working group. In total, we included 31 studies (with 3231 participants) in our review. Of those 31 studies, 28 (2976 participants) provided data for the meta-analyses. For the 28 studies, 24 were used for the comparison of neuraxial block versus general anaesthesia.

For this second updated version of the review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL and Web of Science from 2011 to April 2013. We included randomized controlled trials comparing neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal or epidural anaesthesia) versus other types of anaesthesia in adults (18 years or older) with arterial vascular obstruction undergoing lower-limb revascularization surgery. Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed trial quality. We pooled the data on mortality, myocardial infarction, lower-limb amputation and pneumonia. We summarized dichotomous data as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model. In this updated version of the review, we found no new studies that met our inclusion criteria. We included in this review four studies that compared neuraxial anaesthesia with general anaesthesia. The total number of participants was 696, of whom 417 were allocated to neuraxial anaesthesia and 279 to general anaesthesia. Participants allocated to neuraxial anaesthesia had a mean age of 67 years, and 59% were men. Participants allocated to general anaesthesia had a mean age of 67 years, and 66% were men. Four studies had an unclear risk of bias. No difference was observed between participants allocated to neuraxial or general anaesthesia in mortality rate (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.07; 696 participants; four trials), myocardial infarction (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.70; 696 participants; four trials), and lower-limb amputation (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.84; 465 participants; three trials). Pneumonia was less common after neuraxial anaesthesia than after general anaesthesia (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.89; 201 participants; two trials). Evidence was insufficient for cerebral stroke, duration of hospital stay, postoperative cognitive dysfunction, complications in the anaesthetic recovery room and transfusion requirements. No data described nerve dysfunction, postoperative wound infection, patient satisfaction, postoperative pain score, claudication distance and pain at rest. Available evidence from included trials that compared neuraxial anaesthesia with general anaesthesia was insufficient to rule out clinically important differences for most clinical outcomes.

We randomly assigned 53 patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome (including 28 described previously), all of whom were receiving identical hemodynamic and general support, to conventional or protective mechanical ventilation. Conventional ventilation was based on the strategy of maintaining the lowest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for acceptable oxygenation, with a tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of body weight and normal arterial carbon dioxide levels (35 to 38 mm Hg). Protective ventilation involved end-expiratory pressures above the lower inflection point on the static pressure-volume curve, a tidal volume of less than 6 ml per kilogram, driving pressures of less than 20 cm of water above the PEEP value, permissive hypercapnia, and preferential use of pressure-limited ventilatory modes.

Only two stroke scales have been applied in the perioperative setting after cardiac, carotid and neurological surgeries. The modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale appears to be useful in detecting new subtle neurological deficits in critical care, or high dependency units after surgery.

We then sought to demonstrate the validity and reliability of the new mNIHSS. The mNIHSS was derived from our prior clinimetric studies of the NIHSS by deleting poorly reproducible or redundant items (level of consciousness, face weakness, ataxia, dysarthria) and collapsing the sensory item into 2 responses. Reliability of the mNIHSS was assessed with the certification data originally collected to assess the reliability of investigators in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) rtPA (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) Stroke Validity of the mNIHSS was assessed with the outcome results of the NINDS rtPA Stroke Trial: Reliability was improved with the mNIHSS: the number of scale items with poor kappa coefficients on either of the certification tapes decreased from 8 (20%) to 3 (14%) with the mNIHSS. With the use of factor analysis, the structure underlying the mNIHSS was found identical to the original scale. On serial use of the scale, goodness of fit coefficients were higher with the mNIHSS. With data from part I of the trial data, the proportion of patients who improved >/=4 points within 24 hours after treatment was statistically significantly increased by tPA (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence limits, 1.0, 1.8; P=0.05).

The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with >100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format. Results- These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings. Conclusions- These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke.

This important group of patients could potentially be assessed more rapidly than others and could be candidates for interventional therapies. However, delays in recognition and assessment are common, possibly related to comorbidities and the complexities of hospital practice. Risk factors for in-hospital stroke include specific operations and procedures (eg, cardiac surgery), previous medical disorders (especially a history of stroke), and certain physiological characteristics (including fever and dehydration). The stroke subtype is embolic in a large proportion, and there are various possible precipitating mechanisms. Outcome can be poor, with high mortality. Interventional therapies, particularly thrombolysis, are possible options. In the postoperative setting, intra-arterial thrombolysis is feasible and reasonably safe in carefully selected patients. Experimental agents and the manipulation of physiological variables are other treatment possibilities that could be applied early in this group of patients. Increasing the awareness by hospital physicians of such interventions may be an important factor that reduces delays in assessment of patients who have stokes while in hospital.",success

An inpatient code stroke algorithm was developed, and an educational intervention was implemented over 5 months. Data were recorded and compared between the 36-month period before and the 15-month period after the intervention was implemented. Outcome measures included time from last seen normal to initial assessment and from last seen normal to brain imaging. During the study period, there were 218 inpatient strokes (131 before the intervention and 87 after the intervention). Inpatient strokes were more common on cardiovascular wards (45% of cases) and occurred mainly during the perioperative period (60% of cases). After implementation of an inpatient code stroke intervention and educational initiative, there were consistent reductions in all timed outcome measures (median time to initial assessment fell from 600 [109-1460] to 160 [35-630] minutes and time to computed tomographic scan fell from 925 [213-1965] to 348.5 [128-1587] minutes).

We formed the HERMES collaboration to pool patient-level data from five trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND IA) done between December, 2010, and December, 2014. In these trials, patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior artery circulation were randomly assigned to receive either endovascular thrombectomy within 12 h of symptom onset or standard care (control), with a primary outcome of reduced disability on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. By direct access to the study databases, we extracted individual patient data that we used to assess the primary outcome of reduced disability on mRS at 90 days in the pooled population and examine heterogeneity of this treatment effect across prespecified subgroups. To account for between-trial variance we used mixed-effects modelling with random effects for parameters of interest. We then used mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models to calculate common odds ratios (cOR) for the primary outcome in the whole population (shift analysis) and in subgroups after adjustment for age, sex, baseline stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), site of occlusion (internal carotid artery vs M1 segment of middle cerebral artery vs M2 segment of middle cerebral artery), intravenous alteplase (yes vs no), baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, and time from stroke onset to randomisation. We analysed individual data for 1287 patients (634 assigned to endovascular thrombectomy, 653 assigned to control). Endovascular thrombectomy led to significantly reduced disability at 90 days compared with control (adjusted cOR 2.49, 95% CI 1.76-3.53; p<0.0001). The number needed to treat with endovascular thrombectomy to reduce disability by at least one level on mRS for one patient was 2.6. Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint showed no heterogeneity of treatment effect across prespecified subgroups for reduced disability (pinteraction=0.43).

Fibrinolytic treatment is contraindicated due to elevated risk for hemorrhage. Mechanical thrombectomy entails a catheterized approach wherein the thrombus is physically removed from the vessel without the use of fibrinolytics, minimizing the possibility of intracranial hemorrhage. Here, we present two original cases of mechanical thrombectomy as treatment for patients experiencing emergent large vessel occlusion following cardiothoracic surgery. A literature review was conducted to determine current treatment guidelines, risk factors, and complications resulting from recanalization due to mechanical thrombectomy versus fibrinolytic therapy. One patient was admitted due to chronic, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage D, New York Heart Association functional class IV heart failure and required complete, artificial hemodynamic support for two weeks and on the 19<sup>th</sup> day experienced neurologic decline secondary to a supraclinoid left internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. Mechanical thrombectomy resulted in distal reperfusion and neurologic improvement. The second patient presented with coronary artery disease and underwent triple coronary artery bypass grafting and endovein harvesting. On post-operative day 2, the patient experienced a left ICA occlusion extending to the cavernous ICA resulting in speech impairment and right-sided weakness. The patient was heparinized and underwent mechanical thrombectomy, resulting in immediate speech and muscle strength recovery. Medical advances allow mechanical thrombectomy to be performed in a timely and effective manner at specialized treatment centers. It offers endovascular treatment modalities to a unique patient population with postoperative stroke. In such patients, thrombectomy can safely provide reperfusion while reducing the risk of complications associated with conventional thrombolytics.",success

Only trials that required vessel imaging to identify patients with proximal anterior circulation ischaemic stroke and that used predominantly stent retrievers or second-generation neurothrombectomy devices in the EVT group were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane handbook methodology. Central investigators, masked to clinical information other than stroke side, categorised baseline imaging features of ischaemic change with the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) or according to involvement of more than 33% of middle cerebral artery territory, and by thrombus volume, hyperdensity, and collateral status. The primary endpoint was neurological functional disability scored on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days after randomisation. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, parenchymal haematoma type 2 within 5 days of randomisation, and mortality within 90 days. For the primary analysis, we used mixed-methods ordinal logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission, intravenous alteplase, and time from onset to randomisation, and we used interaction terms to test whether imaging categorisation at baseline modifies the association between treatment and outcome. This meta-analysis was prospectively designed by the HERMES executive committee but has not been registered. Among 1764 pooled patients, 871 were allocated to the EVT group and 893 to the control group. Risk of bias was low except in the THRACE study, which used unblinded assessment of outcomes 90 days after randomisation and MRI predominantly as the primary baseline imaging tool.

Summary of Review- There is a strong indication that treatment may still be beneficial beyond 3 hours up until 4.5 hours. The risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage is not increased in patients aged 80 years or older. Excluding patients with severe stroke or with early ischemic changes in more than one third of the middle cerebral artery territory on baseline CT scan is probably not necessary when treatment is started <3 hours of symptom onset. Patients with minor or improving symptoms can also benefit. Intravenous thrombolysis appears appropriate as first line therapy for posterior circulation stroke. Alteplase can be given to patients with cervical artery dissection, seizure at onset and evidence of acute ischemia on brain imaging, and after carefully weighing risk and benefit in pregnancy and during menstruation. There are anecdotal reports on its use in children, patients with recent myocardial infarction, cardiac embolus, intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, prior stroke and recent surgery. There appears to be a substantially increased risk of symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage in hyperglycemic stroke patients.

The typical final volume of large vessel, supratentorial ischemic stroke is 54 mL (varied in sensitivity analysis from 19 to 100 mL). The average duration of nonlacunar stroke evolution is 10 hours (range 6 to 18 hours), and the average number of neurons in the human forebrain is 22 billion.

However, data are scarce on the association between the time from onset and reperfusion results. To analyze the rate of reperfusion after EVT started at different intervals after symptom onset in patients with AIS. We conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 7 randomized trials of the Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices (HERMES) group. This is a multicenter cohort study of the intervention arm of randomized clinical trials included in the HERMES group. Patients with anterior circulation AIS who underwent EVT for M1/M2 or intracranial carotid artery occlusion were included. Each trial enrolled patients according to its specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data on patients eligible but not enrolled (eg, refusals or exclusions) were not available. All analyses were performed by the HERMES biostatistical core laboratory using the pooled database. Data were analyzed between December 2010 and April 2015. Successful reperfusion was defined as a modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 at the end of the EVT procedure adjusted for age, occlusion location, pretreatment intravenous thrombolysis, and clot burden score and was analyzed in relation to different intervals (onset, emergency department arrival, imaging, and puncture) using mixed-methods logistic regression. Among the 728 included patients, with a mean (SD) age of 65.4 (13.5) years and of whom 345 were female (47.4%), decreases in rates of successful reperfusion defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b/3 were observed with increasing time from admission or first imaging to groin puncture. The magnitude of effect was a 22% relative reduction (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95) per additional hour between admission and puncture and a 26% relative reduction (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93) per additional hour between imaging and puncture.

Median onset-to-puncture time was 230 minutes (IQR, 170-305) and median door-to-puncture time was 87 minutes (IQR, 62-116), with substantial reperfusion in 85.9% (5433/6324) of patients. Adverse events were sICH in 6.7% (449/6693) of patients and in-hospital mortality/hospice discharge in 19.6% (1326/6756) of patients. At discharge, 36.9% (2132/5783) ambulated independently and 23.0% (1225/5334) had functional independence (mRS 0-2). In onset-to-puncture adjusted analysis, time-outcome relationships were nonlinear with steeper slopes between 30 to 270 minutes than 271 to 480 minutes. In the 30- to 270-minute time frame, faster onset to puncture in 15-minute increments was associated with higher likelihood of achieving independent ambulation at discharge (absolute increase, 1.14% [95% CI, 0.75%-1.53%]), lower in-hospital mortality/hospice discharge (absolute decrease, -0.77% [95% CI, -1.07% to -0.47%]), and lower risk of sICH (absolute decrease, -0.22% [95% CI, -0.40% to -0.03%]).

We added data from ECASS III (821 patients) and EPITHET (100 patients) to a pool of common data elements from six other trials of alteplase for acute stroke (2775 patients). We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the relation of stroke onset to start of treatment (OTT) with treatment on favourable 3-month outcome (defined as modified Rankin score 0-1), mortality, and occurrence and outcome of clinically relevant parenchymal haemorrhage. The presence of an arterial occlusion was inferred from the patient's symptoms and absence of haemorrhage or other causes of ischaemic stroke. Vascular imaging was not a requirement in the trials. All patients with confirmed OTT within 360 min were included in the analysis. Treatment was started within 360 min of stroke onset in 3670 patients randomly allocated to alteplase (n=1850) or to placebo (n=1820). Odds of a favourable 3-month outcome increased as OTT decreased (p=0.0269) and no benefit of alteplase treatment was seen after around 270 min.

In the combined databases of the SWIFT and STAR trials, we identified patients treated with the Solitaire stent retriever with achievement of substantial reperfusion (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [TICI] 2b-3). Ordinal numbers needed to treat values were derived by populating joint outcome tables. Among 202 patients treated with ET with TICI 2b to 3 reperfusion, mean age was 68 (±13), 62% were female, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 17 (interquartile range [IQR]: 14-20). Day 90 modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcomes for OTR time intervals ranging from 180 to 480 minutes showed substantial time-related reductions in disability across the entire outcome range. Shorter OTR was associated with improved mean 90-day mRS (1.4 vs. 2.4 vs. 3.3, for OTR groups of 124-240 vs. 241-360 vs. 361-660 minutes; p < 0.001). The number of patients identified as benefitting from therapy with shorter OTR were 3-fold (range, 1.5-4.7) higher on ordinal, compared with dichotomized analysis. For every 15-minute acceleration of OTR, 34 per 1,000 treated patients had improved disability outcome. Analysis of disability over the entire outcome range demonstrates a marked effect of shorter time to reperfusion upon improved clinical outcome, substantially higher than binary metrics.

These specialized ambulances have made the diagnosis and treatment of many neurological emergencies, in addition to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, possible at the emergency site. Providing treatment as early as possible, including within the prehospital phase of stroke management, improves patient outcomes.

Using our MSTU database, we identified patients that underwent IAT for AIS. We compared the key time metrics to historical controls, which included patients that underwent IAT at our institution six months prior to implementation of the MSTU. We further divided the controls into two groups: (1) transferred to our institution for IAT and (2) directly presented to our emergency room and underwent IAT.

On the MSU, IAT decision-making steps, such as computed tomography, neurological exam, and tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) treatment are completed before emergency department arrival. We hypothesized that such pre-ED assessment of potential IAT patients on an MSU improves the time from ED arrival to skin puncture time (door-to-puncture-time, DTPT). Methods- BEST-MSU is a prospective comparative effectiveness study of MSU versus standard management by emergency medical services (EMS). We compared ED DTPT among the following groups of MSU and EMS patients: all IAT patients, IAT patients post-tPA, and IAT patients post-tPA meeting thrombolytic adjudication criteria over the first 4 years of the study. Results- From August 2014 to July 2018, a total of 161 patients underwent IAT. Ninety-four patients presented to the ED via the MSU and 67 by EMS. One hundred forty patients received tPA before IAT, 85 in the MSU arm, and 55 in the EMS arm. One hundred twenty-six patients received tPA within thrombolytic adjudication criteria: 76 MSU and 50 EMS. DTPT in minutes was shorter for MSU patients (all IAT MSU versus EMS 89 versus 99, P=0.01; IAT post-tPA MSU versus EMS 93 versus 100, P=0.03; and IAT post-tPA within adjudicated criteria MSU versus EMS 93 versus 99.5, P=0.03). From 2014 to 2018, DTPT decreased at a faster rate for EMS compared with MSU-managed patients, improving by about an hour. Conclusions- Pre-ED IAT evaluation on an MSU results in faster DTPT compared with arrival by EMS. Since 2014, dramatic improvement in ED IAT metrics has attenuated this difference. However, DTPT in all groups indicates substantial room for improvement.",success

Six MPRCTs (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, EXTEND IA, SWIFT PRIME, REVASCAT and THERAPY) incorporating image-based LVO AIS were selected for assessing the following: (1) prespecified primary clinical outcomes of AIS patients in intervention and control arms: good outcomes were defined by a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days; (2) secondary clinical outcomes were: (a) revascularization rates [favorable outcomes defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale (mTICI) score of 2b/3]; (b) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) rates and mortality; (c) derivation of number needed to harm (NNH), number needed to treat (NNT), and relative percent difference (RPD) between intervention and control groups, and (d) random effects model to determine overall significance (forest and funnel plots). A total of 1,386 patients were included. Good outcomes at 90 days were seen in 46% of patients in the intervention (p < 0.00001) and in 27% of patients in the control groups (p < 0.00002).

Methods- Patients from prospectively collected databases of 6 international comprehensive stroke centers with large vessel occlusions (distal intracranial internal carotid, middle cerebral artery-M1 and M2 segments, or basilar artery with or without tandem occlusions) and NIHSS 0 to 5 were identified and divided into 2 groups for analysis: immediate MT or initial best medical management which included rescue MT after neurological deterioration (best medical management-MT). Uni- and multivariate analyses and patient-level matching for age, baseline NIHSS, and occlusion site were performed to compare baseline and outcome variables across the 2 groups. The primary outcome was defined as good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) at day 90. Safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage as defined by the ECASS (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study) II and mortality at day 90. Results- Compared with best medical management-MT (n=220), patients with immediate MT (n=80) were younger (65.3±13.5 versus 69.5±14.1; P=0.021), had more often atrial fibrillation (44.8% versus 28.2%; P=0.012), higher baseline NIHSS (4, 0-5 versus 3, 0-5; P=0.005), higher Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (10, 7-10 versus 10, 5-10; P=0.023), more middle cerebral artery-M1, and less middle cerebral artery-M2 (41.3% versus 21.9% and 28.8% versus 49.3%; P=0.016) occlusions.

33069327,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Rigorous analysis of levels and trends in exposure to leading risk factors and quantification of their effect on human health are important to identify where public health is making progress and in which cases current efforts are inadequate. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a standardised and comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of risk factor exposure, relative risk, and attributable burden of disease. GBD 2019 estimated attributable mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 87 risk factors and combinations of risk factors, at the global level, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories. GBD uses a hierarchical list of risk factors so that specific risk factors (eg, sodium intake), and related aggregates (eg, diet quality), are both evaluated. This method has six analytical steps. (1) We included 560 risk-outcome pairs that met criteria for convincing or probable evidence on the basis of research studies. 12 risk-outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 no longer met inclusion criteria and 47 risk-outcome pairs for risks already included in GBD 2017 were added based on new evidence. (2) Relative risks were estimated as a function of exposure based on published systematic reviews, 81 systematic reviews done for GBD 2019, and meta-regression. (3) Levels of exposure in each age-sex-location-year included in the study were estimated based on all available data sources using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method, or alternative methods. (4) We determined, from published trials or cohort studies, the level of exposure associated with minimum risk, called the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. (5) Attributable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were computed by multiplying population attributable fractions (PAFs) by the relevant outcome quantity for each age-sex-location-year. (6) PAFs and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors were estimated taking into account mediation of different risk factors through other risk factors. Across all six analytical steps, 30 652 distinct data sources were used in the analysis. Uncertainty in each step of the analysis was propagated into the final estimates of attributable burden. Exposure levels for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risk factors were summarised with use of the summary exposure value to facilitate comparisons over time, across location, and across risks. Because the entire time series from 1990 to 2019 has been re-estimated with use of consistent data and methods, these results supersede previously published GBD estimates of attributable burden. The largest declines in risk exposure from 2010 to 2019 were among a set of risks that are strongly linked to social and economic development, including household air pollution; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; and child growth failure. Global declines also occurred for tobacco smoking and lead exposure. The largest increases in risk exposure were for ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index. In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for attributable deaths was high systolic blood pressure, which accounted for 10·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 9·51-12·1) deaths (19·2% [16·9-21·3] of all deaths in 2019), followed by tobacco (smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted for 8·71 million (8·12-9·31) deaths (15·4% [14·6-16·2] of all deaths in 2019). The leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable DALYs globally in 2019 was child and maternal malnutrition, which largely affects health in the youngest age groups and accounted for 295 million (253-350) DALYs (11·6% [10·3-13·1] of all global DALYs that year). The risk factor burden varied considerably in 2019 between age groups and locations. Among children aged 0-9 years, the three leading detailed risk factors for attributable DALYs were all related to malnutrition. Iron deficiency was the leading risk factor for those aged 10-24 years, alcohol use for those aged 25-49 years, and high systolic blood pressure for those aged 50-74 years and 75 years and older. Overall, the record for reducing exposure to harmful risks over the past three decades is poor. Success with reducing smoking and lead exposure through regulatory policy might point the way for a stronger role for public policy on other risks in addition to continued efforts to provide information on risk factor harm to the general public.

In the interim, numerous studies have expanded our understanding of this association and further elucidated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved. The main objective of this updated American Heart Association scientific statement is to provide a comprehensive review of the new evidence linking PM exposure with cardiovascular disease, with a specific focus on highlighting the clinical implications for researchers and healthcare providers. The writing group also sought to provide expert consensus opinions on many aspects of the current state of science and updated suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached, including the following: Exposure to PM <2.5 microm in diameter (PM(2.5)) over a few hours to weeks can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years) increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the population by several months to a few years; reductions in PM levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between PM(2.5) exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially since the first American Heart Association scientific statement was published.

We aim to assess association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and progression of coronary artery calcium and common carotid artery intima-media thickness. In this prospective 10-year cohort study, we repeatedly measured coronary artery calcium by CT in 6795 participants aged 45-84 years enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air) in six metropolitan areas in the USA. Repeated scans were done for nearly all participants between 2002 and 2005, for a subset of participants between 2005 and 2007, and for half of all participants between 2010 and 2012. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured by ultrasound in all participants at baseline and in 2010-12 for 3459 participants. Residence-specific spatio-temporal pollution concentration models, incorporating community-specific measurements, agency monitoring data, and geographical predictors, estimated concentrations of PM2.5 and nitrogen oxides (NOX) between 1999 and 2012. The primary aim was to examine the association between both progression of coronary artery calcium and mean carotid artery intima-media thickness and long-term exposure to ambient air pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, NOX, and black carbon) between examinations and within the six metropolitan areas, adjusting for baseline age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, site, and CT scanner technology. In this population, coronary calcium increased on average by 24 Agatston units per year (SD 58), and intima-media thickness by 12 μm per year (10), before adjusting for risk factors or air pollutant exposures. Participant-specific pollutant concentrations averaged over the years 2000-10 ranged from 9.2-22.6 μg PM2.5/m(3) and 7.2-139.2 parts per billion (ppb) NOX. For each 5 μg PM2.5/m(3) increase, coronary calcium progressed by 4.1 Agatston units per year (95% CI 1.4-6.8) and for each 40 ppb NOX coronary calcium progressed by 4.8 Agatston units per year (0.9-8.7). Pollutant exposures were not associated with intima-media thickness change. The estimate for the effect of a 5 μg/m(3) higher long-term exposure to PM2.5 in intima-media thickness was -0.9 μm per year (95% CI -3.0 to 1.3). For 40 ppb higher NOX, the estimate was 0.2 μm per year (-1.9 to 2.4). Increased concentrations of PM2.5 and traffic-related air pollution within metropolitan areas, in ranges commonly encountered worldwide, are associated with progression in coronary calcification, consistent with acceleration of atherosclerosis.

Our aim was to directly estimate the health and longevity impacts of current PM2.5 concentrations and the benefits of reductions from 1999 to 2015, nationally and at county level, for the entire contemporary population of the contiguous United States. We used vital registration and population data with information on sex, age, cause of death, and county of residence. We used four Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different adjustments for other determinants of mortality, to directly estimate mortality and life expectancy loss due to current PM2.5 pollution and the benefits of reductions since 1999, nationally and by county. The covariates included in the adjusted models were per capita income; percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, who are of Black or African American race, who have graduated from high school, who live in urban areas, and who are unemployed; cumulative smoking; and mean temperature and relative humidity. In the main model, which adjusted for these covariates and for unobserved county characteristics through the use of county-specific random intercepts, PM2.5 pollution in excess of the lowest observed concentration (2.8 μg/m3) was responsible for an estimated 15,612 deaths (95% credible interval 13,248-17,945) in females and 14,757 deaths (12,617-16,919) in males. These deaths would lower national life expectancy by an estimated 0.15 years (0.13-0.17) for women and 0.13 years (0.11-0.15) for men. The life expectancy loss due to PM2.5 was largest around Los Angeles and in some southern states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Alabama. At any PM2.5 concentration, life expectancy loss was, on average, larger in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate than in wealthier counties. Reductions in PM2.5 since 1999 have lowered mortality in all but 14 counties where PM2.5 increased slightly. The main limitation of our study, similar to other observational studies, is that it is not guaranteed for the observed associations to be causal. We did not have annual county-level data on other important determinants of mortality, such as healthcare access and quality and diet, but these factors were adjusted for with use of county-specific random intercepts.

AQHI reporting at a neighbourhood scale was recognized as addressing geographic variability and uncertainty in perceived versus measured air quality impacting health. Participants predominantly expressed that they relied on sensory cues (i.e. feel, sight, taste) to determine when to implement health protective behaviours. Time constraints were identified as barriers; whereas local media reporting and wearable devices were identified as facilitators to AQHI adoption. Increasing knowledge, emphasizing relevance, and reporting AQHI information at a neighbourhood scale via local media sources and wearable devices may facilitate AQHI adoption while accounting for SES differences.",success

Over 3 million people die annually of ischemic heart disease or stroke attributed to air pollution, more than from traditional cardiac risk factors such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, or smoking. Clinicians have a role to play in reducing the burden of pollution-attributable cardiovascular disease. However, there currently exists no clear clinical approach to this problem. Here, we provide a blueprint for an evidence-based clinical approach to assessing and mitigating cardiovascular risk from exposure to air pollution. We begin with a discussion of the global burden of pollution-attributable cardiovascular disease, including a review of the mechanisms by which particulate matter air pollution leads to cardiovascular outcomes. Next, we offer a simple patient-screening tool using known risk factors for pollution exposure. We then discuss approaches to quantifying air pollution exposures and cardiovascular risk, including the development of risk maps for clinical catchment areas. We review a collection of interventions for household and outdoor air pollution, which clinicians can tailor to patients and populations at risk. Finally, we identify future research needed to quantify pollution exposures and validate clinical interventions. Overall, we demonstrate that clinicians can be empowered to mitigate the global burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to air pollution.",success

Amniotic fluid embolism is often overdiagnosed in critically ill peripartum women, particularly when an element of coagulopathy is involved. Previously proposed case definitions for amniotic fluid embolism are nonspecific, and when viewed through the eyes of individuals with experience in critical care obstetrics, would include women with a number of medical conditions much more common than amniotic fluid embolism. We convened a working group under the auspices of a committee of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the Amniotic Fluid Embolism Foundation whose task was to develop uniform diagnostic criteria for the research reporting of amniotic fluid embolism. These criteria rely on the presence of the classic triad of hemodynamic and respiratory compromise accompanied by strictly defined disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. It is anticipated that limiting research reports involving amniotic fluid embolism to women who meet these criteria will enhance the validity of published data and assist in the identification of risk factors, effective treatments, and possibly useful biomarkers for this condition.

The pathophysiology appears to involve an abnormal maternal response to fetal tissue exposure associated with breaches of the maternal-fetal physiologic barrier during parturition. This response and its subsequent injury appear to involve activation of proinflammatory mediators similar to that seen with the classic systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Progress in our understanding of this syndrome continues to be hampered by a lack of universally acknowledged diagnostic criteria, the clinical similarities of this condition to other types of acute critical maternal illness, and the presence of a broad spectrum of disease severity. Clinical series based on population or administrative databases that do not include individual chart review by individuals with expertise in critical care obstetrics are likely to both overestimate the incidence and underestimate the mortality of this condition by the inclusion of women who did not have amniotic fluid embolism. Data regarding the presence of risk factors for amniotic fluid embolism are inconsistent and contradictory; at present, no putative risk factor has been identified that would justify modification of standard obstetric practice to reduce the risk of this condition.

Cognizant of the difficulty in determining precise timing of arrest in clinical practice, if fetal status is already compromised further delay while attempting to assess fetal heart rate, locating optimal surgical equipment, or transporting to an operating room will result in unnecessary worsening of both maternal and fetal condition. Even if intrauterine demise has already occurred, maternal resuscitative efforts will typically be markedly improved following delivery with uterine decompression.

This study aimed to pool data from multiple countries in order to describe risk factors, management, and outcomes of AFE and to explore the impact on the findings of considering United Kingdom, international, and United States AFE case definitions. A population-based cohort and nested case-control study was conducted using the International Network of Obstetric Survey Systems (INOSS). Secondary data on women with AFE (n = 99-218, depending on case definition) collected prospectively in population-based studies conducted in Australia, France, the Netherlands, Slovakia, and the UK were pooled along with secondary data on a sample of control women (n = 4,938) collected in Australia and the UK. Risk factors for AFE were investigated by comparing the women with AFE in Australia and the UK with the control women identified in these countries using logistic regression. Factors associated with poor maternal outcomes (fatality and composite of fatality or permanent neurological injury) amongst women with AFE from each of the countries were investigated using logistic regression or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The estimated incidence of AFE ranged from 0.8-1.8 per 100,000 maternities, and the proportion of women with AFE who died or had permanent neurological injury ranged from 30%-41%, depending on the case definition. However, applying different case definitions did not materially alter findings regarding risk factors for AFE and factors associated with poor maternal outcomes amongst women with AFE. Using the most liberal case definition (UK) and adjusting for the severity of presentation when appropriate, women who died were more likely than those who survived to present with cardiac arrest (89% versus 40%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.93-28.48, p < 0.001) and less likely to have a source of concentrated fibrinogen (40% versus 56%, aOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.92, p = 0.029) or platelets given (24% versus 49%, aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.52, p < 0.001).

Limitations of the study include limited statistical power to examine factors associated with poor maternal outcome and the potential for residual confounding or confounding by indication. The findings of our study suggest that when an AFE is suspected, initial supportive obstetric care is important, but having an obstetrician and/or anaesthetist present at the time of the AFE event and use of interventions to correct coagulopathy, including the administration of an adequate dose of tranexamic acid, may be important to improve maternal outcome.

Multivariable regression model was also performed; C-statistic and Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were used to assess the model fit. A result was considered statistically significant at P<.05. Of the 213 women, 110 (51.6%) had delayed treatment vs 103 (48.4%) who were treated within 60 minutes. Patients who had delayed treatment were 3.2 times more likely to have an initial blood pressure in the nonsevere range vs those who had timely treatment (odds ratio, 3.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-5.68). Timeliness of treatment was associated with presence or absence of preeclampsia symptoms; patients without preeclampsia symptoms were 2.7 times more likely to have delayed treatment (odds ratio, 2.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-4.80). Patients with hypertensive emergencies that occurred overnight between 10 pm and 6 am were 2.7 times more likely to have delayed treatment vs those emergencies that occurred between 6 am and 10 pm (odds ratio, 2.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-5.83). Delayed treatment also had an association with race, with white patients being 1.8 times more likely to have delayed treatment (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.08). Patients who were treated at <60 minutes had a lower gestational age at presentation vs those with delayed treatment (34.6±5 vs 36.6±4 weeks, respectively; P<.001). For every 1-week increase in gestational age at presentation, there was a 9% increase in the likelihood of delayed treatment (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.19). Another factor that was associated with delay of treatment was having a complaint of labor symptoms, which made patients 2.2 times as likely to experience treatment delay (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-4.41). Initial blood pressure in the nonsevere range, absence of preeclampsia symptoms, presentation overnight, white race, having complaint of labor symptoms, and increasing gestational age at presentation are barriers that lead to a delay in the treatment of obstetric hypertensive emergency.

34023314,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant patients receive expeditious treatment with first-line antihypertensive agents within 1 hour of confirmed severe hypertension to reduce the risk for maternal stroke. However, it is unknown how often this guideline is followed and what factors influence a patient's likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant care. We aimed to identify factors associated with receiving guideline-concordant treatment for an obstetrical hypertensive emergency. We present a case-control study of all pregnant and postpartum patients who had persistent severe hypertension (≥2 systolic blood pressures ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mm Hg, or both within 1 hour of each other) during their delivery hospitalization at a tertiary hospital from October 1, 2013, to August 31, 2020. Data were extracted from the hospital electronic medical records using standard definitions and billing and diagnosis codes. We defined receipt of the recommended treatment as administration of a first-line antihypertensive agent (intravenous labetalol, intravenous hydralazine, or immediate-release oral nifedipine) within 60 minutes of the first or second severe-range blood pressure measurement during their delivery hospitalization. Delayed treatment was defined as the administration of a first-line agent >60 minutes after the second elevated blood pressure measurement. Patients were considered untreated if a first-line agent was never administered. Maternal sociodemographic, clinical and pregnancy factors, and time and day of the week of the hypertensive emergency were compared among patients who received the recommended treatment, those who received delayed treatment, and those who were untreated. Bivariate analyses were performed, and multinomial and multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounders. Of the 39,918 deliveries in the cohort, 1987 (5.0%) were complicated by severe, persistent obstetrical hypertension. Of these patients, 532 (26.8%) received the recommended treatment, 356 (17.9%) received delayed treatment, and 1099 (55.3%) did not receive any first-line antihypertensive therapy. The multinomial regression models that were used to compare these 3 groups indicated that patients who received the recommended treatment were more likely to be Black (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-2.51), Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.52), or pregnant and at <37 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratio, 6.65; 95% confidence interval, 5.08-8.72). Treatment was less likely if the severe obstetrical hypertension emergency occurred overnight (7:00 PM to 6:59 AM) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.97) or during the postpartum period (adjusted odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.86). Approximately half of obstetrical patients with at least 2 documented severely elevated blood pressure measurements did not receive the recommended antihypertensive treatment. Of those who did receive treatment, about 40% had delayed treatment. Black and Hispanic race and preterm gestation were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving the recommended treatment when compared with White race and term pregnancies. Patients whose severe obstetrical hypertension emergency occurred overnight and those who were postpartum were less likely to receive any first-line antihypertensive treatment. Overall, patients without sociodemographic and clinical risk factors for severe obstetrical hypertension or other pregnancy complications were less likely to be treated. However, treatment improved significantly over time with the implementation of targeted quality measures and specific institutional policies based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' latest severe obstetrical hypertension management guidelines.",success

State and national guidelines have been proposed to increase treatment of patients with hypertensive emergencies or critically elevated blood pressures. There are limited data available to assess the impact of these recommendations on maternal morbidity. The purpose of this prospective quality improvement project was to determine if maternal morbidity would be improved using a standardized approach for treatment of critically elevated blood pressures. In all, 23 hospitals participated in this project. Treatment recommendations included the use of an intravenous blood pressure medication and magnesium sulfate when there was a sustained blood pressure of ≥160 mm Hg systolic and/or ≥110 mm Hg diastolic. Compliance with the metric recommendations was monitored based on the number of patients treated with an intravenous blood pressure medication, use of magnesium sulfate, and if they received a timely postpartum follow-up appointment. The metric was scored as all or none; missing any of the 3 metric components was considered noncompliant. From January through June 2015 baseline data were collected and hospitals were made aware that ongoing monitoring of compliance would begin in July 2015 through June 2016. The primary outcomes were composite metric compliance, the incidence of eclampsia per 1000 births, and severe maternal morbidity. During the 18 months of this study there were 69,449 births. Within this population, 2034 met criteria for a critically elevated blood pressure, preeclampsia, or superimposed preeclampsia with severe features. Of this group, 1520 had a sustained critical blood elevation. Initial compliance with treatment recommendations was low (50.5%) and increased to >90% after April 2016 (P < .001). Compliance with utilization of intravenous blood pressure medication increased by 33.2%, from a baseline of 57.1-90.3% (P < .01) during the last 6 months of monitoring. Compliance with utilization of magnesium sulfate increased by 10.8%, from a baseline of 85.4-96.2% (P < .01). The incidence of eclampsia declined by 42.6% (1.15 ± 0.15/1000 to 0.62 ± 0.09/1000 births). Severe maternal morbidity decreased by 16.7% from 2.4 ± 0.10% to 2.0 ± 0.15% (P < .01). We noted 3 important findings: (1) compliance with state and national treatment guidelines is low without monitoring; (2) high levels of compliance can be achieved in a relatively short period of time; and (3) early intervention with intravenous blood pressure medication and magnesium sulfate for verified sustained critical maternal blood pressures resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of eclampsia and severe maternal morbidity. The reduction in the rate of eclampsia could only partially be attributed to the increase in the use of magnesium sulfate, suggesting an additive or synergistic effect of the combined treatment of an antihypertensive medication and magnesium sulfate on the rate of eclampsia and severe maternal morbidity.",success

This study aimed to determine whether pulse pressure predicts response to the various first-line antihypertensive medications. This is a retrospective cohort study from a single academic tertiary care center between 2015 and 2018. Patients were screened for inclusion if they had severe hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure of ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥110 mm Hg) lasting at least 15 minutes and were initially treated with intravenous labetalol, intravenous hydralazine, or immediate-release oral nifedipine. If a patient had multiple episodes of acute treatment during the pregnancy, only one episode was included in the analysis. The primary outcome was time to resolution (in minutes) of severe hypertension. To adjust for factors that may have affected time to resolution, we first compared baseline characteristics on the basis of the antihypertensive agent received. We then assessed the association between baseline characteristics and resolution of severe hypertension within 60 minutes of treatment. Regression analysis incorporated pulse pressure and antihypertensive agents into a model to predict resolution within 60 minutes of onset of severe hypertension. A total of 479 women hospitalized with severe maternal hypertension met the inclusion criteria. Hydralazine was the initial antihypertensive agent administered to 113 women, whereas 233 received labetalol, and 133 received nifedipine. Those who initially received nifedipine had a shorter mean time to resolution of severe hypertension (32.6 minutes vs 46.3 for hydralazine and 50.3 for labetalol; P<.01) and were more likely to have resolution of severe hypertension within 60 minutes (91.0% vs 77.9% for hydralazine and 76.8% for labetalol; P<.01). Nifedipine also resulted in a lower mean posttreatment blood pressure. Regression analysis revealed that a lack of resolution of severe hypertension within 60 minutes was independently associated with 2 measures of hypertension severity (mean arterial pressure of ≥125 mm Hg and the need for ≥2 doses of medication) and pulse pressure of >75 mm Hg at the time of treatment, initial treatment with labetalol, and gestational age of <37 weeks at the time of the hypertensive event (or at delivery if treatment was after delivery). The model's bias-corrected bootstrapped area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.88). Interaction terms between pulse pressure and each antihypertensive agent were not significant and therefore not incorporated into the final model. Pulse pressure did not predict response to the various first-line antihypertensive agents. Initial treatment with oral nifedipine was associated with a higher likelihood of resolution of severe hypertension within 60 minutes of treatment than with intravenous labetalol.",success

Although the cause remains unknown, discussion sections highlight new insights into the epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, pathology, natural history, and long-term outcomes. Prompt diagnosis is essential, and an updated algorithm defines supplemental information to be used to assist the diagnosis when classic clinical criteria are incomplete. Although intravenous immune globulin is the mainstay of initial treatment, the role for additional primary therapy in selected patients is discussed. Approximately 10% to 20% of patients do not respond to initial intravenous immune globulin, and recommendations for additional therapies are provided. Careful initial management of evolving coronary artery abnormalities is essential, necessitating an increased frequency of assessments and escalation of thromboprophylaxis. Risk stratification for long-term management is based primarily on maximal coronary artery luminal dimensions, normalized as <i>Z</i> scores, and is calibrated to both past and current involvement.

These processes could be involved in aneurysm formation and recovery in KD. Coronary artery tissues from 8 KD patient autopsies were stained to detect proteins in the TGF-β pathway, to characterize myofibroblasts, and to detect Tregs. Expression of proteins in the TGF-β pathway was noted in infiltrating mononuclear cells and spindle-shaped cells in the thickened intima and adventitia.

Methods and Results A 34-institution international registry of 1651 patients with KD who had CAAs (maximum CAA <i>Z</i> score ≥2.5) was used. Time-to-event analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models for risk factor analysis.

No complications were observed in patients with a CAA <i>Z</i> score <10. Higher CAA <i>Z</i> score and a greater number of coronary artery branches affected were associated with increased risk of all types of complications. At 10 years, normalization of luminal diameter was noted in 99±4% of patients with small (2.5≤<i>Z</i><5.0), 92±1% with medium (5.0≤<i>Z</i><10), and 57±3% with large CAAs (<i>Z</i>≥10).

The Am I ON TRAC for Adult Care questionnaire was refined to improve the instrument's methodological soundness. A literature review informed the revisions. A convenience sample of 200 adolescents, 12-19 years, was recruited from four outpatient clinics at a paediatric hospital in Western Canada between April-June 2012. Construct validity was evaluated by Exploratory Factory Analysis; concurrent validity was assessed using the Psychosocial Maturity Index. Internal consistency was evaluated by computing Cronbach's alpha estimates. Factor analysis of the knowledge items identified a 14-item unidimensional scale. Knowledge and behaviour sub-scale scores increased with age, with a stronger relationship between knowledge and age. Psychosocial maturity correlated with both sub-scale scores, but had a stronger association with behaviour. Psychosocial maturity and age had a weak but significant correlation suggesting age is a loose proxy for maturity. Only 27% of 17-year olds, but 62% 18-year olds, scored above the behaviour cut-off for transition readiness.

Item and scale development of the UNC TR(x)ANSITION Scale was informed by two theoretical models, available literature, and expert opinion interviews and feedback from youth with chronic conditions, their parents, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Through an iterative process, three versions of the scale were piloted on a total of 185 adolescents and emerging adults with different chronic illnesses. This clinically administered scale relies on a semi-structured interview format of the patient and does not rely solely on patient report, but is verified with information from the medical record to validate responses. Following the item development and the three iterations of the scale, version 3 was examined in a more intensive fashion. The current version of the UNC TR(x)ANSITION Scale comprises 33 items scattered across the following 10 domains: Type of illness, Rx=medications, Adherence, Nutrition, Self-management, Informed-reproduction, Trade/school, Insurance, Ongoing support, and New health providers. It requires approximately 7-8 min to administer. With a sample of 128 adolescents and young adults, ranging in age from 12 to 20, inter-rater reliability was strong (r = 0.71) and item-total correlation scores were moderate to high. Content and construct validity were satisfactory, and the overall score was sensitive to advancing age. The univariate linear regression yielded a beta coefficient of 1.08 (p < 0.0001), indicating that the total score increased with advancing age. Specifically, there was about a one point increase in the total score for each year of age. The UNC TR(x)ANSITION Scale is a disease-neutral tool that can be used in the clinical setting. Initial findings suggest that it is a reliable and valid tool that has the potential to measure health-care transition skill mastery and knowledge in a multidimensional fashion.",success

In this study we examine the concurrent, predictive, and discriminant validity of the STARx Questionnaire. To examine concurrent validity, the STARx Questionnaire was compared to two other published transition readiness tools. Predictive validity was examined using linear regressions between the STARx Total Score and literacy, medication adherence, quality of life, and health services use. Discriminant validity was examined by comparing the performance of three chronic illness conditions on the STARx Total Score and associated subscales. The STARx Questionnaire and its subscales positively correlated with the scores for both transition readiness tools reflecting strong concurrent validity. The STARx Questionnaire also correlated positively with the literacy, self-efficacy, and adherence measures indicating strong predictive validity; however, it did not correlate with either quality of life or health care utilization. The performance of AYA across three different clinical conditions was not significant, indicating the clinical utility of this HCT tool for a variety of chronic health conditions.

Since the vast majority of Kawasaki disease initially presents at <5 years of age, many adult cardiologists are unfamiliar with the pathophysiology of this disease. This vasculitis has a predilection for coronary arteries with a high complication rate across the lifespan for those with medium to large coronary artery aneurysms. An inflammatory cascade produces endothelial dysfunction and damage to the vascular wall, leading to aneurysmal dilatation. Later, pseudonormalisation of the vascular lumen occurs through vascular remodelling and layering thrombus, but this does not necessarily indicate resolution of disease or reduction of risk for future complications. There is a growing prevalence of Kawasaki disease, making it increasingly relevant for adult cardiologists as this population transitions into adulthood. As the 2017 American Heart Association (AHA) and 2014 Japanese Circulation Society (JCS) guidelines emphasise, Kawasaki disease requires rigorous follow-up with cardiac stress testing and non-invasive imaging to detect progressive stenosis, thrombosis and luminal occlusion that may lead to myocardial ischaemia and infarction.

These observations set the stage for trajectories as an emerging construct to target health-service interventions. The lifelong cardiovascular and systemic complications of CHD make the long-term care of these patients challenging for cardiologists and internists alike. A life-course approach is thus required to facilitate our understanding of the natural history and to orient our clinical efforts.

Going high with heart disease: The effect of high altitude exposure in older individuals and patients with coronary artery disease. High Alt Med Biol 16:89-96, 2015.--Ischemic heart disease is the largest cause of death in older men and women in the western world (Lozano et al., 2012 ; Roth et al., 2015). Atherosclerosis progresses with age, and thus age is the dominant risk factor for coronary heart disease in any algorithm used to assess risk for cardiovascular events. Subclinical atherosclerosis also increases with age, providing the substrate for precipitation of acute coronary syndromes. Thus the risk of high altitude exposure in older individuals is linked closely with both subclinical and manifest coronary heart disease (CHD). There are several considerations associated with taking patients with CHD to high altitude: a) The reduced oxygen availability may cause or exacerbate symptoms; b) The hypoxia and other associated environmental conditions (exercise, dehydration, change in diet, thermal stress, emotional stress from personal danger or conflict) may precipitate acute coronary events; c) If an event occurs and the patient is far from advanced medical care, then the outcome of an acute coronary event may be poor; and d) Sudden death may occur. Physicians caring for older patients who want to sojourn to high altitude should keep in mind the following four key points: 1). Altitude may exacerbate ischemic heart disease because of both reduced O2 delivery and paradoxical vasoconstriction; 2). Adverse events, including acute coronary syndromes and sudden cardiac death, are most common in older unfit men, within the first few days of altitude exposure; 3). Ensuring optimal fitness, allowing for sufficient acclimatization (at least 5 days), and optimizing medical therapy (especially statins and aspirin) are prudent recommendations that may reduce the risk of adverse events; 4). A graded exercise test at sea level is probably sufficient for most clinical decision making and will allow for assessment of exercise capacity, and provocable ischemia. Given these considerations, most older individuals with CHD should be able to tolerate exposure to high altitude safely, and with minimal increased risk.",success

There was no significant difference in the decrease of the exercise level and maximum heart rate between patients and healthy controls (-31 vs. -30%, p=0.673).Conclusion. Both patients and healthy controls showed a similar decrease in exercise capacity and maximum heart rate at 4200 m compared with sea level, suggesting that patients with a history of coronary artery disease may tolerate stay and exercise at high altitude similarly to healthy controls.

Exposure to high altitude significantly increased diastolic (P < 0.005) and mean blood pressure (BP) (P < 0.05, after prolonged exposure) in placebo but not in the acetazolamide group. Therefore, subjects on acetazolamide showed significantly lower values of diastolic (P < 0.005) and mean BP (P < 0.05) at altitude. Furthermore, they also showed significantly lower values of systolic BP (P < 0.05). Pulse wave velocity did not change at high altitude, while the augmentation index, normalized for a theoretical heart rate of 75 b.p.m., significantly increased (P < 0.05) under placebo, but not under acetazolamide. In a multivariate model, unadjusted augmentation index at high altitude was not affected by BP changes, while significant determinants were heart rate and gender. Acute exposure to high altitude induced a rise in brachial BP and changes in pulse waveform-derived parameters, independent from changes in mean BP and partly counteracted by treatment with acetazolamide.

One hundred untreated subjects with mild hypertension (screening blood pressure, 144.1±9.8 mm Hg systolic, 92.0±7.5 mm Hg diastolic) were randomized to double-blind placebo or to telmisartan 80 mg+modified release nifedipine 30 mg combination. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed off-treatment, after 6 weeks of treatment at sea level, on treatment during acute exposure to high altitude (3260 m) and immediately after return to sea level. Eighty-nine patients completed the study (age, 56.4±17.6 years; 52 men/37 women; body mass index, 28.2±3.5 kg/m(2)). Twenty-four-hour systolic blood pressure increased at high altitude in both groups (placebo, 11.0±9 mm Hg; P<0.001 and active treatment, 8.1±10.4 mm Hg; P<0.001). Active treatment reduced 24-hour systolic blood pressure both at sea level and at high altitude (147.9±11.1 versus 132.6±12.4 mm Hg for placebo versus treated; P<0.001; 95% confidence interval of the difference 10.9-19.9 mm Hg) and was well tolerated.

Abnormal V(E)/V(CO2) slope was reduced by carvedilol. Hypoxia increased ventilation but less with carvedilol; exercise capacity decreased to 87+/-21W (placebo) and to 80+/-11 W (carvedilol, p < 0.01). With hypoxia, carvedilol decreased V(E)/V(CO2) slope. At constant workload exercise with hypoxia, PaO2 decreased to 69+/-6 mm Hg (placebo) and to 64+/-5 (carvedilol, p < 0.01). Carvedilol reduced hyperventilation possibly by reducing peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity as suggested by PaCO2 increase with normoxia and PaO2 decrease with hypoxia without V(CO2) and V(D)/V(T) changes.

Intrathoracic pressure with the Valsalva maneuver was recorded as mouth pressure by having the subject maintain an open glottis while expiring against a column of Hg during the lifts. Exercises included single-arm curls, overhead presses, and both double- and single-leg presses performed to failure at 80, 90, 95, and 100% of maximum. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures rose rapidly to extremely high values during the concentric contraction phase for each lift and declined with the eccentric contraction. The greatest peak pressures occurred during the double-leg press where the mean value for the group was 320/250 mmHg, with pressures in one subject exceeding 480/350 mmHg. Peak pressures with the single-arm curl exercise reached a mean group value of 255/190 mmHg when repetitions were continued to failure. Mouth pressures of 30-50 Torr during a single maximum lift, or as subjects approached failure with a submaximal weight, indicate that a portion of the observed increase in blood pressure was caused by a Valsalva maneuver. It was concluded that when healthy young subjects perform weight-lifting exercises the mechanical compression of blood vessels combines with a potent pressor response and a Valsalva response to produce extreme elevations in blood pressure.

Thus, a case-control analysis between persons who died suddenly during mountain hiking and randomly selected controls was carried out. Risk factor profiles of 179 males over the age of 34 who suffered SCD during mountain hiking were compared to those of 537 matched controls. Hikers who died suddenly during mountain hiking were much more likely to have had a prior MI (17% vs. 0.9%; p < 0.001), known coronary artery disease (CAD) without prior MI (17 % vs. 4%; p < 0.001), diabetes (6% vs. 1 %; p < 0.001), hypercholesterolemia (54 % vs. 20%; p < 0.001), and were less engaged in regular mountain sports activities (31% vs. 58%; p < 0.001) compared to hikers from the control group.

Whereas mountaineering activities may contribute to the well established beneficial effects of regular exercise, for certain individuals these activities are also associated with a relatively high risk of death. This manuscript presents an updated overview of risk and protective factors for sudden cardiac death during leisure activities in the mountains. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been proven to be the most frequent cause of non traumatic death in males aged over 34 years, e.g. during mountain hiking, cross country skiing or downhill skiing. Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and, in particular, prior myocardial infarction, are the most important risk factors for SCD, predominantly relevant in downhill skiers. The unusual physical exertion on the first day at altitude, the late morning hours and the prolonged abstinence from food and fluid intake during exercise at altitude are most important triggers. Acute hypoxia may represent a trigger for SCD on the one hand but might also evoke beneficial effects by preconditioning on the other hand. The identification of high-risk subjects and SCD triggers, evidence-based therapy of treatable risk factors, the appropriate individual preparation by physical training, and considering behavioural aspects, especially at the beginning of the physically active altitude sojourn will help to prevent SCD and increase the health benefits generated by mountaineering activities.",success

Thus, risk assessment regarding high altitude exposure of patients with CHD is of increasing interest, and individual recommendations are expected despite the lack of sufficient scientific evidence. The major factor increasing cardiac stress is hypoxia. At rest and for a given external workload, myocardial oxygen demand is increased at altitude, particularly in nonacclimatized individuals, and there is some evidence that blood-flow reserve is reduced in atherosclerotic coronary arteries even in the absence of severe stenosis. Despite a possible imbalance between oxygen demand and oxygen delivery, studies on selected patients have shown that exposure and exercise at altitudes of 3000 to 3500 m is generally safe for patients with stable CHD and sufficient work capacity. During the first days at altitude, patients with stable angina may develop symptoms of myocardial ischemia at slightly lower heart rate x  blood-pressure products. Adverse cardiac events, however, such as unstable angina coronary syndromes, do not occur more frequently compared with sea level except for those who are unaccustomed to exercise. Therefore, training should start before going to altitude, and the altitude-related decrease in exercise capacity should be considered. Travel to 3500 m should be avoided unless patients have stable disease, preserved left ventricular function without residual capacity, and above-normal exercise capacity. CHD patients should avoid travel to elevations above 4500 m owing to severe hypoxia at these altitudes. The risk assessment of CHD patients at altitude should always consider a possible absence of medical support and that cardiovascular events may turn into disaster.",success

Consequently, many patients are willing to spend leisure time at altitude, usually <3500 m, but their safety in doing so is undefined. HF is a syndrome that often has relevant co-morbidities, such as pulmonary hypertension, COPD, unstable cardiac ischemia, and anemia. HF co-morbidities may per se impede a safe stay at altitude. Exercise at simulated altitude is associated with a reduction in performance, which is greater in HF patients than in normal subjects and greater in patients with most severe HF. In normal subjects, the reduction in performance is ∼2% every 1000 m altitude increase, whereas it is 4% and 10% in HF patients with normal or slightly diminished exercise capacity and in HF patients with markedly diminished exercise capacity. On-field experience with HF patients at altitude is limited to subjects driven to altitude (3454 m) for a few hours. The data showed a reduction in exercise capacity similar to that reported at simulated altitude. ""Optimal"" HF treatment in patients spending time at altitude is likely different from optimal treatment at sea level, particularly as regards β-blockers. Carvedilol, a β1-β2-α-blocker, reduces the hypoxic ventilatory response through a reduction of the chemoreflex response, and it reduces alveolar-capillary gas diffusion, which is under control by β2-receptors. These actions are not shared by selective β1-blockers such as bisoprolol and nebivolol, which should be preferred for treatment of HF patients willing to spend time at altitude. In conclusion, spending time at altitude (<3500 m) is safe for HF patients, provided that subjects are free of co-morbidities that may directly interfere with the adaptation to altitude. However, HF patients experience a reduction of exercise capacity in proportion to HF severity and altitude. Finally, HF patients should undergo a specific ""altitude-tailored treatment"" to avoid pharmacological interference with altitude adaptation mechanisms.",success

We hypothesized that patients after the Fontan operation, who lack a functional subpulmonary ventricle, would have a limited exercise capacity at altitude, with an inability to increase cardiac output.

METHODS Thirty-four patients with OSA of median age 62 years (IQR 57-65), median apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) 47.5 events/h (IQR 32.4-72.8), residing at <600 m were enrolled. A crossover trial randomised for the sequence of altitude exposure was carried out: patients spent 1 day in Zurich (490 m) and 4 days in the Swiss Alps at 1860 m and 2590 m (2 days each) during which continuous positive airway pressure was discontinued. Daily evaluations included polysomnography, symptom questionnaires, physical examination and driving simulator tests. RESULTS Polysomnography revealed median oxygen saturations at 490 m and in the first and second nights at 1860 and 2590 m, respectively, of 94%, 90%, 90%, 86% and 87% (p<0.01 between altitudes).

High Alt Med Biol 16:110-116, 2015.--Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in the general population, in particular in men and women of older age. In OSA patients sleeping near sea level, the apneas/hypopneas associated with intermittent hypoxemia are predominantly due to upper airway collapse. When OSA patients stay at altitudes above 1600 m, corresponding to that of many tourist destinations, hypobaric hypoxia promotes frequent central apneas in addition to obstructive events, resulting in combined intermittent and sustained hypoxia. This induces strong sympathetic activation with elevated heart rate, cardiac arrhythmia, and systemic hypertension. There are concerns that these changes expose susceptible OSA patients, in particular those with advanced age and co-morbidities, to an excessive risk of cardiovascular and other adverse events during a stay at altitude. Based on data from randomized trials, it seems advisable for OSA patients to use continuous positive airway pressure treatment with computer controlled mask pressure adjustment (autoCPAP) in combination with acetazolamide during an altitude sojourn. If CPAP therapy is not feasible, acetazolamide alone is better than no treatment at all, as it improves oxygenation and sleep apnea and prevents excessive blood pressure rises of OSA patients at altitude.",success

Opium contains high concentrations of both morphine and codeine, along with thebaine, which is used in the synthesis of a number of semisynthetic opioid analgesics. Thus, it is not surprising that new agents were initially based upon the morphine scaffold. The concept of multiple opioid receptors was first suggested almost 50 years ago (Martin, 1967), opening the possibility of new classes of drugs, but the morphine-like agents have remained the mainstay in the medical management of pain. Termed mu, our understanding of these morphine-like agents and their receptors has undergone an evolution in thinking over the past 35 years. Early pharmacological studies identified three major classes of receptors, helped by the discovery of endogenous opioid peptides and receptor subtypes-primarily through the synthesis of novel agents.

However, altered opioid metabolism may also influence response in terms of efficacy and tolerability, and several factors contributing to this metabolic variability have been identified. For example, the risk of drug interactions with an opioid is determined largely by which enzyme systems metabolize the opioid.

Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed (1) data from an ongoing study that uses structured, self-administered surveys to gather retrospective data on past drug use patterns among patients entering substance abuse treatment programs across the country who received a primary (DSM-IV) diagnosis of heroin use/dependence (n = 2797) and (2) data from unstructured qualitative interviews with a subset of patients (n = 54) who completed the structured interview. In addition to data on population demographics and current residential location, we used cross-tabulations to assess prevalence rates as a function of the decade of the initiation of abuse for (1) first opioid used (prescription opioid or heroin), (2) sex, (3) race/ethnicity, and (4) age at first use. Respondents indicated in an open-ended format why they chose heroin as their primary drug and the interrelationship between their use of heroin and their use of prescription opioids. Approximately 85% of treatment-seeking patients approached to complete the Survey of Key Informants' Patients Program did so.

Although overdose contributes most to drug-associated mortality, infectious complications of intravenous drug use constitute a major cause of morbidity leading to hospitalization (4). In addition to infections from hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), injecting drug users are at increased risk for acquiring invasive bacterial infections, including endocarditis (5,6). Evidence that hospitalizations for endocarditis are increasing in association with the current opioid epidemic exists (7-9). To examine trends in hospitalizations for endocarditis among persons in North Carolina with drug dependence during 2010-2015, data from the North Carolina Hospital Discharge database were analyzed. The incidence of hospital discharge diagnoses for drug dependence combined with endocarditis increased more than twelvefold from 0.2 to 2.7 per 100,000 persons per year over this 6-year period. Correspondingly, hospital costs for these patients increased eighteenfold, from $1.1 million in 2010 to $22.2 million in 2015. To reduce the risk for morbidity and mortality related to opioid-associated endocarditis, public health programs and health care systems should consider collaborating to implement syringe service programs, harm reduction strategies, and opioid treatment programs.",success

As healthcare systems evolve to address the crisis, the potential of pharmacists to make a positive difference is significant. In addition to utilizing available prescription drug monitoring programs to help prevent diversion of opioids, practicing pharmacists can be alert for signs of opioid misuse by patients (e.g., multiple prescriptions from different physicians) as well as inappropriate prescribing or hazardous drug combinations that physicians may not be aware of (e.g., opioid analgesics combined with benzodiazepines). They can also supply patients with information on risks of opioids, proper storage and disposal of medications, and the harms (and illegality) of sharing medications with other people. Increasingly, pharmacies are sites of distribution of the opioid antagonist naloxone, which has been shown to save lives when made available to opioid users and their families or other potential bystanders to an overdose; and pharmacists can provide guidance about its use and even legal protections for bystanders to an overdose that customers may not be aware of. Pharmacists can also recommend addiction treatment to patients and be a resource for information on addiction treatment options in the community. As addiction treatment becomes more integrated with general healthcare, pharmacies are also increasingly dispensing medications like buprenorphine and, in the future, possibly methadone. Pharmacists in private research labs and at universities are helping to develop the next generation of addiction treatments and safer, non-addictive pain medications; they can also play a role in implementation research to enhance the delivery of addiction interventions and medications in pharmacy settings.

Stopping treatment with opioids was measured as the time when a patient was estimated to have no prescription for opioids, up to the end of the next fiscal year (2014) or the patient's death. 2887 deaths from overdose or suicide were found. The incidence of stopping opioid treatment was 57.4% (n<i>=</i>799 668) overall, and based on length of opioid treatment was 32.0% (≤30 days), 8.7% (31-90 days), 22.7% (91-400 days), and 36.6% (>400 days).

Hazard ratios for patients who stopped opioid treatment (with reference values for all other covariates) were 1.67 (≤30 days), 2.80 (31-90 days), 3.95 (91-400 days), and 6.77 (>400 days). Descriptive life table data suggested that death rates for overdose or suicide increased immediately after starting or stopping treatment with opioids, with the incidence decreasing over about three to 12 months. Patients were at greater risk of death from overdose or suicide after stopping opioid treatment, with an increase in the risk the longer patients had been treated before stopping. Descriptive data suggested that starting treatment with opioids was also a risk period. Strategies to mitigate the risk in these periods are not currently a focus of guidelines for long term use of opioids. The associations observed cannot be assumed to be causal; the context in which opioid prescriptions were started and stopped might contribute to risk and was not investigated.

The effectiveness of the REMS program for reducing adverse outcomes also could not be assessed because the analyses used nonrepresentative samples, lacked adequate controls for confounding, and did not link prescribing or clinical outcomes to prescribers' receipt of CE training. Although the FDA had requested studies tracking adverse outcomes as a function of CE training, the FDA concluded that these studies had not been performed as of the 60-month report in 2017.

Regular opioid exposure also induces euphoria making these compounds addictive and often misused, as shown by the current epidemic of opioid abuse and overdose mortalities. In addition to the effect of opioids on their cognate receptors and signaling cascades, these compounds also induce multiple adaptations at cellular and behavioral levels. As omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) play a ubiquitous role in behavioral and cellular processes, we proposed that supplemental n-3 PUFAs, enriched in docosahexanoic acid (DHA), could offset these adaptations following chronic opioid exposure. We used an 8 week regimen of n-3 PUFA supplementation followed by 8 days of morphine in the presence of this diet. We first assessed the effect of morphine in different behavioral measures and found that morphine increased anxiety and reduced wheel-running behavior. These effects were reduced by dietary n-3 PUFAs without affecting morphine-induced analgesia or hyperlocomotion, known effects of this opiate acting at mu opioid receptors. At the cellular level we found that morphine reduced striatal DHA content and that this was reversed by supplemental n-3 PUFAs. Chronic morphine also increased glutamatergic plasticity and the proportion of Grin2B-NMDARs in striatal projection neurons. This effect was similarly reversed by supplemental n-3 PUFAs. Gene analysis showed that supplemental PUFAs offset the effect of morphine on genes found in neurons of the dopamine receptor 2 (D2)-enriched indirect pathway but not of genes found in dopamine receptor 1(D1)-enriched direct-pathway neurons. Analysis of the D2 striatal connectome by a retrogradely transported pseudorabies virus showed that n-3 PUFA supplementation reversed the effect of chronic morphine on the innervation of D2 neurons by the dorsomedial prefontal and piriform cortices.

The study was designed to be a cross-sectional observational study. Consecutive patients with primary diagnosis of AF who qualified for first-ever catheter ablation between 2011 and 2013 were enrolled. All patients had an overnight polysomnography performed for the diagnosis of OSA and calculation of a 2MACE score-a cardiovascular risk assessment score for AF. We studied 211 AF patients (mean age 57.1 ± 10.2 years, 62.6% males). OSA with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15/h was found in 48 patients (22.7%).

A significantly higher percentage of patients with OSA was at high risk of cardiovascular disease (29.2 vs. 8.1%; p < 0.0001). The trend remained significant in different categories of obstructive sleep apnea when categorized by AHI into non-OSA, and mild, moderate, and severe OSA. Similarly, the mean 2MACE score was statistically significantly higher in OSA than non-OSA patients (2.1 ± 1.1 vs. 1.4 ± 1.0; p < 0.0001).

Overall, longer sleep duration was associated with lower adiposity indicators, better emotional regulation, better academic achievement, and better quality of life/well-being. The evidence was mixed and/or limited for the association between sleep duration and cognition, harms/injuries, and cardiometabolic biomarkers. The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high across study designs and health indicators. In conclusion, we confirmed previous investigations showing that shorter sleep duration is associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes.

Central nervous or cardiovascular system morbidity, growth failure or enuresis and predictors of SDB persistence in the long-term are recognised (steps 2 and 3), and SDB severity is determined objectively preferably using polysomnography (step 4). Children with an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) >5 episodes·h(-1), those with an AHI of 1-5 episodes·h(-1) and the presence of morbidity or factors predicting SDB persistence, and children with complex conditions (e.g. Down syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome) all appear to benefit from treatment (step 5).

There is strong evidence that childhood SDB is associated with deficits in behavior and emotion regulation, scholastic performance, sustained attention, selective attention, and alertness. There is also evidence that SDB has minimal association with a child's typical mood, expressive language skills, visual perception, and working memory. Findings have been insufficient to draw conclusions about intelligence, memory, and some aspects of executive functioning. Mechanisms by which SDB might result in neurobehavioral morbidity are being explored, but clinical symptoms such as chronic snoring remain the best predictors of morbidity. Short-term SDB treatment outcome studies are encouraging, but the long-term outcomes are not known. Failing to treat SDB appears to leave children at risk for long-term neurobehavioral deficits. Childhood SDB is associated with neurobehavioral morbidity. Applying commonly used guidelines for causal inference, even in the absence of a much-needed randomized clinical trial, there is strong evidence of association, consistent findings, and specificity of effect. There is suggestive evidence that this association fits the expected temporal pattern and that SDB is a biologically plausible cause of neurobehavioral deficits.

The literature from 1999 through 2011 was evaluated. A total of 3166 titles were reviewed, of which 350 provided relevant data. Most articles were level II through IV. The prevalence of OSAS ranged from 0% to 5.7%, with obesity being an independent risk factor. OSAS was associated with cardiovascular, growth, and neurobehavioral abnormalities and possibly inflammation. Most diagnostic screening tests had low sensitivity and specificity. Treatment of OSAS resulted in improvements in behavior and attention and likely improvement in cognitive abilities. Primary treatment is adenotonsillectomy (AT). Data were insufficient to recommend specific surgical techniques; however, children undergoing partial tonsillectomy should be monitored for possible recurrence of OSAS. Although OSAS improved postoperatively, the proportion of patients who had residual OSAS ranged from 13% to 29% in low-risk populations to 73% when obese children were included and stricter polysomnographic criteria were used. Nevertheless, OSAS may improve after AT even in obese children, thus supporting surgery as a reasonable initial treatment. A significant number of obese patients required intubation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) postoperatively, which reinforces the need for inpatient observation. CPAP was effective in the treatment of OSAS, but adherence is a major barrier. For this reason, CPAP is not recommended as first-line therapy for OSAS when AT is an option. Intranasal steroids may ameliorate mild OSAS, but follow-up is needed. Data were insufficient to recommend rapid maxillary expansion.",success
24335402,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has become a major public health concern as its incidence and severity have increased in tandem with the obesity epidemic. In children, OSA is now recognized as a common disorder and can be associated with significant morbidity. OSA belongs to a spectrum of diagnoses known as sleep-related breathing disorders in which the airway is completely (apnoea) or partially (hypopnoea) occluded during sleep despite continued respiratory efforts. This airway obstruction can cause abnormal gas exchange leading to hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, sleep fragmentation, and their attendant physiological and behavioural consequences. The degrees of hypercapnia, hypoxaemia, and upper airway airflow reduction are the primary factors determining the severity of OSA. In young children, adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the most common anatomical abnormality associated with OSA, and adenotonsillectomy is, therefore, the most common surgical intervention. Perioperative complications associated with adenotonsillectomy are more common in children with severe OSA. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of OSA, careful and complete preoperative assessment, meticulous intraoperative and postoperative management, and early recognition of potential perioperative complications are essential to optimization of outcomes. The safe anaesthetic management of a child with OSA requires an anaesthetic technique tailored to the underlying aetiology and severity of OSA and the surgical procedure.

The OSA group had poorer sleep efficiency (p<0.05), spent a smaller proportion of their sleep period time in rapid eye movement (REM) (p<0.05), and had significantly fewer spontaneous arousals (p<0.001) compared with controls. One-quarter of the children with OSA had a sleep pressure score above the cut-off point for increased sleep pressure. In children with OSA, 62% of obstructive respiratory events terminated in a cortical arousal and 21% in a sub-cortical arousal. A significantly higher proportion of obstructive respiratory events terminated in a cortical arousal during non-REM (NREM) compared with REM (p<0.001). These findings suggest that in pre-school children OSA has a profound effect on sleep and arousal patterns. Given that these children are at a critical period for brain development, the impact of OSA may have more severe consequences than in older children.",success

The spectrum of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing ranges from habitual snoring to partial or complete airway obstruction, termed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Breathing patterns due to airway narrowing are highly variable, including obstructive cycling, increased respiratory effort, flow limitation, tachypnea, and/or gas exchange abnormalities. As a consequence, sleep homeostasis may be disturbed. Increased upper airway resistance is an essential component of OSA, including any combination of narrowing/retropositioning of the maxilla/mandible and/or adenotonsillar hypertrophy. However, in addition to anatomic factors, the stability of the upper airway is predicated on neuromuscular activation, ventilatory control, and arousal threshold. During sleep, most children with OSA intermittently attain a stable breathing pattern, indicating successful neuromuscular activation. At sleep onset, airway muscle activity is reduced, ventilatory variability increases, and an apneic threshold slightly below eupneic levels is observed in non-REM sleep. Airway collapse is offset by pharyngeal dilator activity in response to hypercapnia and negative lumenal pressure. Ventilatory overshoot results in sudden reduction in airway muscle activation, contributing to obstruction during non-REM sleep. Arousal from sleep exacerbates ventilatory instability and, thus, obstructive cycling. Paroxysmal reductions in pharyngeal dilator activity related to central REM sleep processes likely account for the disproportionate severity of OSA observed during REM sleep. Understanding the pathophysiology of pediatric OSA may permit more precise clinical phenotyping, and therefore improve or target therapies related to anatomy, neuromuscular compensation, ventilatory control, and/or arousal threshold.",success

The Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) was prospectively administered to all patients cared for by the cleft lip and palate clinic at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January 2011 and August 2013. The PSQ is a 22-item, validated screening tool for OSA with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.83 and 0.87 in detecting an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >5/hour in healthy children. The Fisher exact and Chi-square tests were used for purposes of comparison. 178 patients with syndromic CL/P completed the PSQ. Mean cohort age was 8.1 ± 4.4 years. Patients were predominately female (53.9%), Caucasian (78.1%), and had Veau Class II cleft (50.6%). Craniofacial syndromes included isolated Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) (29.8%), 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (14.6%), Van der Woude syndrome (6.7%), and other rare genetic abnormalities (28.8%). The overall incidence of positive OSA screening was 32.0%. Males were at increased risk for positive OSA screening (P = 0.030), as were non-Caucasians (P = 0.044). Symptoms with the highest positive predictive value for OSA were ""others comment on child appearing sleepy"" (76.2%) and ""stops breathing during the night"" (75.0%). Notably, patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome were at highest risk for positive screens (50.0%, P = 0.042). Nearly a third of our patients with syndromic CL/P screened positively for OSA (32.0%), highlighting the importance of screening in this at-risk population. Future work will correlate screening results with polysomnograms to help validate these findings. Diagnostic, III.",success

The SDB and blood pressure association remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index percentile or waist circumference, sleep efficiency, percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, and snoring. In addition, older age, body mass index percentile, waist circumference, and snoring were significantly associated with blood pressure, independent of SDB. Based on these findings, our study suggests that SDB is significantly associated with higher levels of systolic blood pressure in children aged 5 to 12 years even after adjusting for the various confounding factors. Clinically, the data support the threshold of AHI >or=5 for the initiation of treatment for SDB. Additional research is indicated to assess the efficacy of SDB treatment on reducing blood pressure.",success

Median (interquartile range) PWD in children with OSAS (median age = 82.8 months, range = 24-194 months) was significantly higher than that in the control group (median age = 73.4 months, range = 12-156 months): 38.3 (29.7-50.5) vs 25.5 (20.5-30.5) milliseconds, respectively (p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis according to OSAS severity categorized by the apnea-hypopnea index from polysomnography demonstrated that PWD in the severe OSAS group (n = 24) was significantly higher than that in the mild-to-moderate OSAS group (n = 53): 48.5 (34.7-67.4) vs 35.5 (28.2-47.8) milliseconds, respectively (p = 0.006). A cut-off value of PWD at 26.5 ms from the receiver operating characteristic curve for the diagnosis showed the area under the curve to be 0.839, with a sensitivity of 89.6% and a specificity of 61.4%. PWD was significantly increased in children with OSAS, particularly in severe cases. PWD could be a useful tool for screening childhood OSAS.",success

A cluster randomized controlled trial with 14 secondary schools in Hong Kong and a total of 3713 students (intervention: 1545 vs control: 2168; 40.2% boys; mean age ± SD: 14.72 ± 1.53 years) were included in the final analysis. The intervention included a town hall seminar, small class workshops, a slogan competition, a brochure, and an educational Web site. Their parents and teachers were offered sleep education seminars. The control schools did not receive any sleep program. Data were collected before and 5 weeks after the intervention. The students in the intervention group had significantly improved sleep knowledge compared with the control group (mean difference: 3.64 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.21 to 4.07]; Cohen's d = 0.51) as measured by using a sleep knowledge questionnaire. Weekday sleep duration was reduced in both groups, and the significant difference in weekday sleep duration was lost in the intention-to-treat analysis (mean difference: 0:01 [95% CI: -0:00 to 0:04]). In addition, the intervention group had a lower incidence of consuming caffeine-containing energy drinks (adjusted odds ratio: 0.46 [95% CI: 0.22 to 0.99]) and had better behavioral (mean difference: -0.56 [95% CI: -1.02 to -0.10]; Cohen's d = 0.13) and mental health (mean difference: -0.30 [95% CI: -0.15 to -0.46]; Cohen's d = 0.11) outcomes.

Towards these ends, evaluation of psychoeducational program ""Sleep 101"" tailored to college students was undertaken. Following two weeks of sleep-log recordings, participants were randomly assigned to a Sleep 101 (experimental) condition or a sleep monitoring (control) condition. The Sleep 101 condition was comprised of two 90-minute workshops aimed to educate students about healthy sleep practices, helpful thoughts about sleep, and ways to improve sleep. The sleep monitoring group received a sleep hygiene handout and completed sleep logs for the study duration. Sleep 101 participants endorsed fewer maladaptive beliefs and attitudes about sleep, increased sleep hygiene knowledge, and reduced sleep onset latency compared to the sleep monitoring participants. Brief psychoeducational courses may be a cost-effective way to alleviate current, and/or prevent future, sleep problems in young adults.",success

To determine whether a novel intervention, using both light exposure during sleep and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), would increase total sleep time in teenagers by enabling them to go to sleep earlier than usual. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, conducted between November 1, 2013, and May 31, 2016, among 102 adolescents enrolled full-time in grades 9 to 12, who expressed difficulty going to bed earlier and waking up early enough, was composed of 2 phases. In phase 1, participants were assigned to receive either 3 weeks of light or sham therapy and were asked to try to go to sleep earlier. In phase 2, participants received 4 brief CBT sessions in addition to a modified light or sham therapy. All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Light therapy consisted of receiving a 3-millisecond light flash every 20 seconds during the final 3 hours of sleep (phase 1) or final 2 hours of sleep (phase 2). Sham therapy used an identical device, but delivered 1 minute of light pulses (appearing in 20-second intervals, for a total of 3 pulses) per hour during the final 3 hours of sleep (phase 1) or 2 hours of sleep (phase 2). Light therapy occurred every night during the 4-week intervention. Cognitive behavioral therapy consisted of four 50-minute in-person sessions once per week. Primary outcome measures included diary-based sleep times, momentary ratings of evening sleepiness, and subjective measures of sleepiness and sleep quality. Among the 102 participants (54 female [52.9%]; mean [SD] age, 15.6 [1.1] years), 72 were enrolled in phase 1 and 30 were enrolled in phase 2. Mixed-effects models revealed that light therapy alone was inadequate in changing the timing of sleep. However, compared with sham therapy plus CBT alone, light therapy plus CBT significantly moved sleep onset a mean (SD) of 50.1 (27.5) minutes earlier and increased nightly total sleep time by a mean (SD) of 43.3 (35.0) minutes. Light therapy plus CBT also resulted in a 7-fold greater increase in bedtime compliance than that observed among participants receiving sham plus CBT (mean [SD], 2.21 [3.91] vs 0.29 [0.76]), as well as a mean 0.55-point increase in subjective evening sleepiness as compared with a mean 0.48-point decrease in participants receiving sham plus CBT as measured on a 7-point sleepiness scale. This study found that light exposure during sleep, in combination with a brief, motivation-focused CBT intervention, was able to consistently move bedtimes earlier and increase total sleep time in teenagers. This type of passive light intervention in teenagers may lead to novel therapeutic applications. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01406691.",success
31957650,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is commonly treated with adenotonsillectomy (AT), bringing risk of perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs). We aimed to concurrently identify clinical and polysomnographic predictors of PRAEs in children undergoing AT. Retrospective study of children undergoing AT at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital, with prior in-hospital polysomnography, January 2010 to December 2016. PRAEs included those requiring oxygen, jaw thrust, positive airway pressure, or mechanical ventilation. Relationships of PRAEs to preoperative comorbidities or polysomnography results were examined with univariable logistic regression. Variables with P < .1 and age were included in backward stepwise multivariable logistic regression. Predictive performance (area under the curve, AUC) was validated with bootstrap resampling. Analysis included 374 children, median age 6.1 years; 286 (76.5%) had ≥ 1 comorbidity. 344 (92.0%) had sleep-disordered breathing; 232 (62.0%) moderate-severe; 66 (17.6%) had ≥ 1 PRAE. PRAEs were more frequent in children with craniofacial, genetic, cardiac, airway anomaly, or neurological conditions, AHI ≥ 5 events/h and oxygen saturation nadir ≤ 80% on preoperative polysomnography. Prediction modeling identified cardiac comorbidity (odds ratio [OR] 2.09 [1.11, 3.89]), airway anomaly (OR 3.19 [1.33, 7.49]), and younger age (OR < 3 years: 4.10 (1.79, 9.26; 3 to 6 years: 2.21 [1.18, 4.15]) were associated with PRAEs (AUC 0.74; corrected AUC 0.68). Prediction modeling concurrently evaluating comorbidities and polysomnography metrics identified cardiac disease, airway anomaly, and young age as independent predictors of PRAEs. These findings suggest that medical comorbidity and age are more important factors in predicting PRAEs than PSG metrics in a medically complex population.",success

High-flow air via open nasal cannula (HFNC) as treatment in children remains controversial. We report the efficacy of HFNC in children with OSA and CPAP intolerance, a titration protocol, and a discussion of potential mechanisms. Patients aged 1 to 18 years with OSA (defined by obstructive apnea-hypopnea index [OAHI] greater than 1 event/h) and CPAP intolerance were enrolled. Routine polysomnography data obtained during 1 night wearing HFNC was compared with diagnostic data by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Ten school-age subjects (representing all patients attempting HFNC at our institution to date) with varied medical conditions, moderate to severe OSA, and CPAP intolerance wore HFNC from 10 to 50 L/min of room air with oxygen supplementation if needed (room air alone for 6 of the 10). HFNC reduced median OAHI from 11.1 events/h (interquartile range 8.7-18.8 events/h) to 2.1 events/h (1.7-2.2 events/h; <i>P</i> = .002); increased oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) mean from 91.3% (89.6% to 93.5%) to 94.9% (92.4% to 96.0%; <i>P</i> < .002); increased SpO<sub>2</sub> nadir from 76.0% (67.3% to 82.3%) to 79.5% (77.2% to 86.0%; <i>P</i> = .032); decreased SpO<sub>2</sub> desaturation index from 19.2 events/h (12.7-25.8 events/h) to 6.4 events/h (4.7-10.7 events/h; <i>P</i> = .013); and reduced heart rate from 88 bpm (86-91 bpm) to 74 bpm (67-81 bpm; <i>P</i> = .004). Stratified analysis of the 6 subjects with only room air via HFNC, the OAHI, obstructive hypopnea index, and mean SpO<sub>2</sub> still demonstrated improvements (<i>P</i> = .031). High-flow nasal cannula reduces respiratory events, improves oxygenation, reduces heart rate, and may be effective for CPAP intolerant children with moderate to severe OSA.

We aimed to systematically review and synthesize studies published to date on the long-term effects of SDB in children. Meta-analysis and systematic review using PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus (all indexed years). We searched for English-language articles containing original human data from prospective studies, with ≥7 participants, in children ≤18 years of age. Data regarding study design, demographics, clinical characteristics, outcomes, level of evidence, and risk of bias were obtained. Articles were independently reviewed by three investigators. Retrospective and cross-sectional studies were excluded. Of 1701 identified abstracts, 25 articles (combined n = 1418) were ultimately included. All studies reported longitudinal outcomes following treatment of SDB, 21 studies exclusively reporting outcomes after adenotonsillectomy. Therefore, studies were combined to objectively assess the effect of SDB treatment on cardiovascular outcomes. Although all cardiovascular parameters were within the normal range at baseline, at follow-up there was a significant decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular end diastolic diameter, heart rate, mitral Em/Am ratio, and C-reactive protein. There was no significant change in interventricular septum thickness, left ventricular parameters (shortening fraction, systolic and end diastolic diameters, ejection fraction, posterior wall thickness, isovolumetric relaxation time), left atrial diameter, and aortic and pulmonary valve peak velocities. Studies assessing the long-term cardiovascular effects of SDB in children are limited. The available literature indicates effects on autonomic function, right, and left heart function following treatment for SDB. However, well-designed, large-scale, prospective cohort studies (using standardized outcomes) are needed to better understand the relationship of cardiovascular morbidity in the context of pediatric SDB.",success

Evidence suggests that adenotonsillectomy for childhood obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be associated with blood pressure (BP) improvement. However, how adenotonsillectomy is associated with BP in hypertensive and nonhypertensive children with OSA remains unclear. To investigate disparities in BP changes after adenotonsillectomy in hypertensive and nonhypertensive children with OSA. From January 1, 2010, to April 30, 2016, children (aged <18 years) with symptoms of OSA treated at National Taiwan University Hospital were enrolled in this retrospective case series study. Children underwent polysomnography for diagnosis of OSA (apnea-hypopnea index >1). All children with OSA underwent adenotonsillectomy. Preoperative and postoperative overnight polysomnographic data were obtained. Office BP was measured in a sleep center before (nocturnal BP) and after (morning) polysomnography. A total of 240 nonobese children (mean [SD] age, 7.3 [3.0] years; 160 [66.7%] male and 80 [33.3%] female) with OSA were recruited. Postoperatively, the apnea-hypopnea index decreased significantly from 12.1 to 1.7 events per hour (95% CI of difference, -12.3 to -8.4 events per hour). The whole cohort had a significant decrease in nocturnal diastolic BP (66.9 to 64.5 mm Hg; 95% CI of difference, -4.1 to -0.7 mm Hg) and morning diastolic BP (66.9 to 64.4 mm Hg; 95% CI of difference, -4.2 to -0.8 mm Hg). The number (percentage) of patients with diastolic BP in the greater than 95th percentile decreased significantly nocturnally (48 [20.0%] to 33 [13.8%]; 95% CI of difference, -12.1% to -0.4%) and in the morning (52 [21.7%] to 34 [14.2%]; 95% CI of difference, -13.6% to -1.4%). Postoperatively, hypertensive children had a significant decrease in all BP measures, including mean (SD) nocturnal and morning systolic BP (nocturnal: 107.5 [8.6] mm Hg; morning: 106.0 [9.4] mm Hg), systolic BP index (nocturnal: -4.3 [8.6]; morning: -5.7 [8.5]), diastolic BP (nocturnal: 65.1 [11.5] mm Hg; morning: 64.4 [10.1] mm Hg), and diastolic BP index (nocturnal: -10.7 [17.3]; morning: -11.6 [15.7]), whereas the nonhypertensive group had a slight increase in nocturnal systolic BP (103.8 to 105.9 mm Hg; 95% CI of difference, 0.4-3.9 mm Hg). A generalized estimating equation model for subgroup comparisons revealed that children with hypertension, compared with those without, had greater improvement in all BP measures. Hypertensive children with OSA had a significant improvement in BP after adenotonsillectomy. Hypertensive children with OSA should be screened and treated by adenotonsillectomy because proper treatment not only eases OSA symptoms but also potentially prevents future cardiovascular and end-organ disease.",success

Criteria used for the diagnosis of OSA ranged from full-night polysomnography (PSG) to clinical parameters. Three studies had results from preoperative and postoperative PSG. Cardiovascular parameters studied included blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac morphology, and cardiac function. All studies reported an improvement in cardiovascular parameters and OSA symptoms after surgery. Three studies reported improvement in blood pressure, 6 reported improvement in mean pulmonary artery pressures, 7 reported improvement in echocardiographic findings, and 1 reported a decrease in pulse rate and pulse rate variability after T&A for OSA. There is evidence that cardiovascular morbidities associated with OSA are potentially reversible. T&A may have a significant role in reversing the cardiovascular sequelae of OSA. However, there is a paucity of well-designed and powered studies to address this issue.",success
