However, it is unknown whether the severity of OSA influences the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy in patients with OSA and AF. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of OSA severity on the treatment of patients with symptomatic AF using AADs. Sixty-one patients (mean age 62 ± 15 years, 21 women) treated with AADs for symptomatic AF who underwent overnight polysomnography were studied. Rhythm control was prospectively defined as successful if a patient remained on the same AAD therapy for ≥6 months with ≥75% reduction in symptomatic AF burden. Twenty-four patients (40%) had severe OSA. Thirty patients (49%) were rhythm controlled with AADs. Nonresponders to AADs were more likely to have severe OSA than milder disease (52% vs 23%, p <0.05); those with severe OSA were less likely to respond to AADs than participants with nonsevere OSA (39% vs 70%, p = 0.02). Nonresponders had higher apnea-hypopnea indexes than responders (34 ± 25 vs 22 ± 18 events/hour, p = 0.05), but there were no differences between these groups in minimum oxygen saturation or percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep.

It consists of eight dichotomous (yes/no) items related to the clinical features of sleep apnea. The total score ranges from 0 to 8. Patients can be classified for OSA risk based on their respective scores. The sensitivity of STOP-Bang score ≥ 3 to detect moderate to severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] > 15) and severe OSA (AHI > 30) is 93% and 100%, respectively. Corresponding negative predictive values are 90% and 100%.

The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as ""good practice statements"", that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations. The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. Good Practice Statements: Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up. Polysomnography is the standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of OSA in adult patients in whom there is a concern for OSA based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation.Recommendations: We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA.

Type 2 diabetes was associated with a significant increase in the risk of AF (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.60) after adjustment for confounders. There was no indication that individuals with pre-diabetes or those with undiagnosed diabetes were at increased risk of AF compared with those without diabetes. A positive linear association was observed between HbA1c and the risk of AF in those with and without diabetes (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.20) and HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15 per 1% point increase, respectively). There was no association between fasting glucose or insulin in those without diabetes, but a significant association with fasting glucose was found in those with the condition.

In analogy to alpha-autoreceptors on sympathetic nerves, muscarinic autoreceptors activated by endogenous acetylcholine may exist on parasympathetic nerves in the human heart. We developed a technique to study acetylcholine release from human atria and investigated muscarinic autoreceptor function. A pharmacological and molecular approach was used to characterize the subtype involved. Of the 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes cloned, only mRNA encoding for M(2)- and M(3)-receptors were detected. Potencies of several muscarinic antagonists against the release-inhibiting effect of the nonselective muscarinic agonist carbachol at the cardiac autoreceptor were correlated with published data for human cloned M(1)- through M(5)-receptors. This analysis clearly indicates that acetylcholine release in human atria is controlled by muscarinic M(2)-receptors. Blockade of these receptors by atropine doubles the amount of acetylcholine released at a stimulation frequency of 5 Hz. In atria of patients >70 years of age and patients with late diabetic complications, acetylcholine release is reduced. Locally impaired cardiac acetylcholine release may therefore represent a pathophysiological link to sudden cardiac death in elderly and diabetic patients.",success

Inducibility of AF was evaluated by 5 times burst pacing from the right atrium and the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was measured. The protocol was repeated during sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) or parasympathetic nerve stimulation (PNS). In tissue samples taken from the right atrium, the density of nerves positive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were determined. SNS significantly increased the incidence of AF in DM rats (14 +/- 6 to 30 +/- 8%, P < 0.01), but not in control rats (11 +/- 4 to 14 +/- 6%, NS). Although AERP was significantly decreased by SNS in both rats (each P < 0.01), increased heterogeneity of AERP by SNS was seen only in DM rats. PNS significantly decreased AERP and increased the incidence of AF (9 +/- 5 to 30 +/- 5% in control rats, 12 +/- 6 to 27 +/- 6% in DM rats, each P < 0.01) in both rats. The density of TH-positive nerves was heterogeneous in DM rats compared with control rats, whereas the heterogeneity of AChE-positive nerves was not different in the rats.

AF rarely exists as a single entity but rather as part of a diverse clinical spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, related to structural and electrical remodeling within the left atrium, leading to AF onset, perpetuation, and progression. Due to the high overall prevalence within the AF population arterial hypertension plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AF and its complications. Fibroblast proliferation, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, gap junction remodeling, accumulation of collagen both in atrial and ventricular myocardium all accompany ageing-related structural remodeling with impact on electrical activity. The presence of hypertension also stimulates oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic activation, which further drives the remodeling process in AF. Importantly, both hypertension and AF independently increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, e.g., stroke and myocardial infarction. Given that both AF and hypertension often present with limited on patient wellbeing, treatment may be delayed resulting in development of complications as the first clinical manifestation of the disease.

In ARISTOTLE (n=18 201), BP was evaluated as history of hypertension requiring treatment and elevated BP (systolic ≥140 and/or diastolic ≥90 mm Hg) at study entry and any point during the trial. Hazard ratios (HRs) were derived from Cox proportional hazards models including BP as a time-dependent covariate. A total of 15 916 (87.5%) patients had a history of hypertension requiring treatment. In patients with elevated BP measurement at any point during the trial, the rate of stroke or systemic embolism was significantly higher (HR, 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.86), as was hemorrhagic stroke (HR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.26-2.72) and ischemic stroke (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.18-1.90).

19937318,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly common arrhythmia that now stands at epidemic proportion, with more than 2.3 million people affected in the USA and over 4.5 million people affected in Western Europe. AF is an expression of underlying heart disease and is increasingly associated with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. It is also a progressive disease secondary to continuous structural remodeling of the atria, which relates to AF itself, to changes associated with aging and to progression of the underlying heart disease. Traditionally, AF has been addressed only after it has already presented with pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies designed for rhythm or rate control (secondary prevention). Although secondary prevention is the most feasible approach at present, the concept of primary prevention of AF with therapies aimed at preventing the development of substrate and correcting the risk factors for AF has emerged as a strategy, which is likely to produce a larger effect in the general population. Recent experiments provided new insights into AF pathophysiology, which generated background for new mechanism-based therapies. Agents targeting inflammation, oxidative injury, atrial myocyte metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis have theoretical advantages as novel therapeutic strategies. In this respect, drugs that are not traditionally antiarrhythmic such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, statins, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown an antiarrhythmic potential in addition to any treatment effect on the underlying disease. These agents are thought to have an advantage of targeting both the occurrence and progression of the substrate for AF, thus, providing primary and secondary prevention of the arrhythmia. Although first experimental and hypothesis-generating small clinical studies or retrospective analyses have been encouraging, several larger, properly designed, prospective trials have not confirmed earlier observations. This review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the possible preventative and reverse remodeling role of statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids in AF.",success

Serial closed-chest electrophysiological studies were performed in each dog at baseline and 2, 4, and 7 days after tachypacing onset. Atrioventricular block was performed to control ventricular rate. Mean duration of induced AF was increased from 42+/-18 to 1079+/-341 seconds at terminal open-chest study after tachypacing alone (P<0.01), and atrial effective refractory period (ERP) at a cycle length of 300 ms was decreased from 117+/-5 to 76+/-6 ms (P<0.01). Tachypacing-induced ERP shortening and AF promotion were unaffected by vitamin C or vitamins C and E; however, simvastatin suppressed tachypacing-induced remodeling effects significantly, with AF duration and ERP averaging 41+/-15 seconds and 103+/-4 ms, respectively, after tachypacing with simvastatin therapy. Tachypacing downregulated L-type Ca2+-channel alpha-subunit expression (Western blot), an effect that was unaltered by antioxidant vitamins but greatly attenuated by simvastatin.

In comparison to participants without triggers and after multivariate adjustment, those reporting triggers had a 71% lower odds of congestive heart failure (odds ratio [OR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14-0.60; P = .001) and a >2-fold greater odds of a family history of AF (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.21-3.47; P = .008). The most commonly reported triggers were alcohol (35%), caffeine (28%), exercise (23%), and lack of sleep (21%). Multivariable models revealed that younger patients, women, and those with an AF family history more commonly experienced various triggers. Patients reported a median of 2 different triggers (interquartile range 1-3). Female sex, Hispanic ethnicity, obstructive sleep apnea, and a family history of AF were each associated with a greater number of AF triggers. Vagally mediated triggers tended to cluster together within individuals. The majority of patient-reported triggers are modifiable, potentially identifying accessible means to prevent and reduce AF episodes. Exploring the interactions between AF patient type, including underlying genetic differences, and common exposures may be fruitful areas of investigation.",success

The study group consisted of 116 patients with lone atrial fibrillation cardioverted within 48h of the onset of arrhythmia; they underwent a series of cognitive tests to evaluate acute psychological stress and personality type. The socio-economic status and other covariates (alcohol consumption, smoking, and body mass index) were investigated. A control group, age- and sex-matched, was selected and compared. In the logistic regression analysis, the presence of spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm was used as the dependent variable. Independent variables were indicator variables representing categories of stress, Type A behaviour pattern, coffee consumption and body mass index. Variables considered for logistic analysis were only those with independent prognostic value. Type A behaviour pattern was found in 23 (20%) patients with atrial fibrillation and in 11 (9%) controls (P<0.001). The mean score among patients with atrial fibrillation was 8+/-2.7, while in control subjects it was 5.5+/-2. The mean acute life stress score among patients with atrial fibrillation was 56+/-33, while in controls it was 34+/-27 (P<0.01). Spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm was observed in 72 patients (63%). In univariate analysis alcohol consumption, income, education and smoking habits did not affect spontaneous conversion. High coffee consumption (OR 0.3 95% CI 0.11-0.49; P<0.008) and high body mass index were associated with a significantly greater risk of atrial fibrillation (OR 1.5 95% CI 1.2-1.7). Type A behaviour pattern and acute life stress affect the development and spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation. Patients with acute stress showed the highest probability of spontaneous conversion followed by patients with Type A behaviour.

We undertook this analysis to evaluate the effect of motivational factors, and clinical factors, including physician diagnosis of overweight, on weight loss in patients with CVD and central obesity in the United States. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2004. Waist circumference ≥ 102 cm in men and ≥ 88 cm in women were used to classify central obesity. We examined demographic, motivational and clinical determinants of attempted and successful weight loss using multivariable logistic regression. Successful weight loss was defined as ≥ 5% weight loss in the preceding year. There were 907 respondents with CVD and central obesity of which 78% were aware of their overweight status and 80% were desirous to weigh less. Despite this awareness and desire, only 49% of centrally obese adults had attempted weight loss in the last year. Only 62% (n = 584) reported that they had been informed that they were overweight by a physician. On multivariable analysis, physician diagnosis of overweight was a significant predictor of weight loss attempts (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.44-4.09, P = .006) and successful weight loss (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.40-5.19, P = .001).

The aims of this review were to assess the effectiveness of advice from physicians in promoting smoking cessation; to compare minimal interventions by physicians with more intensive interventions; to assess the effectiveness of various aids to advice in promoting smoking cessation, and to determine the effect of anti-smoking advice on disease-specific and all-cause mortality. We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in January 2013 for trials of interventions involving physicians. We also searched Latin American databases through BVS (Virtual Library in Health) in February 2013. Randomised trials of smoking cessation advice from a medical practitioner in which abstinence was assessed at least six months after advice was first provided. We extracted data in duplicate on the setting in which advice was given, type of advice given (minimal or intensive), and whether aids to advice were used, the outcome measures, method of randomisation and completeness of follow-up.The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up. We also considered the effect of advice on mortality where long-term follow-up data were available. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates where available. People lost to follow-up were counted as smokers. Effects were expressed as relative risks. Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. We identified 42 trials, conducted between 1972 and 2012, including over 31,000 smokers. In some trials, participants were at risk of specified diseases (chest disease, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease), but most were from unselected populations. The most common setting for delivery of advice was primary care. Other settings included hospital wards and outpatient clinics, and industrial clinics.Pooled data from 17 trials of brief advice versus no advice (or usual care) detected a significant increase in the rate of quitting (relative risk (RR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 1.94). Amongst 11 trials where the intervention was judged to be more intensive the estimated effect was higher (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.13) but there was no statistical difference between the intensive and minimal subgroups. Direct comparison of intensive versus minimal advice showed a small advantage of intensive advice (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.56). Direct comparison also suggested a small benefit of follow-up visits. Only one study determined the effect of smoking advice on mortality. This study found no statistically significant differences in death rates at 20 years follow-up. Simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. Assuming an unassisted quit rate of 2 to 3%, a brief advice intervention can increase quitting by a further 1 to 3%. Additional components appear to have only a small effect, though there is a small additional benefit of more intensive interventions compared to very brief interventions.",success

In the RCTs, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2491 steps per day more than control participants (95% confidence interval [CI], 1098-3885 steps per day, P < .001). Among the observational studies, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2183 steps per day over baseline (95% CI, 1571-2796 steps per day, P < .0001). Overall, pedometer users increased their physical activity by 26.9% over baseline. An important predictor of increased physical activity was having a step goal such as 10,000 steps per day (P = .001).

Despite the widespread adoption of a threshold approach to CPAP management, the literature to date suggests a dose-response relationship between CPAP usage and a range of outcomes, including sleepiness, functional status, and BP; the data also suggest that the optimal adherence level differs depending on the outcome in question. Over the years, psychological measures of behavior change constructs have been increasingly recognized as the most consistent predictors of CPAP adherence, and, as such, the most successful interventions for optimizing adherence have been behavioral in nature. Unfortunately, behavioral therapies have not been translated from highly controlled research settings to comparative-effectiveness studies and finally into routine care, mainly due to feasibility and cost issues. More recently, theory-driven telemedicine adherence interventions have emerged, which take advantage of the framework that already exists in the United States and elsewhere for real-time remote-monitoring of CPAP. Combining theory-driven behavioral approaches with telemedicine technology could hold the answer to increasing real-world CPAP adherence rates, although randomized studies are still required, and socioeconomic barriers to telemedicine will need to be addressed to promote health equity.",success

The first goal in the treatment of AF is to reduce symptoms (eg, palpitations) and a fast ventricular rate. The second goal is to reduce the risk of a stroke. Exercise testing and rehabilitation may be useful once these goals are achieved. However, there are no large, randomized exercise training trials involving patients with AF, and what data are available comes from single-site trials, secondary analyses, and observational studies. There are no specific indications for performing a graded exercise test in patients with AF; however, such testing may be used to screen for myocardial ischemia or evaluate chronotropic response during exertion. Among patients with AF, exercise capacity is 15% to 20% lower and peak heart rate is higher than in patients in sinus rhythm. Exercise rehabilitation improves exercise capacity, likely improves quality of life, and may improve symptoms associated with AF. Whole-body aerobic exercise is recommended.

Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity.

The ACC conducted a multifaceted needs assessment to characterize gaps, practice patterns, and perceptions related to the diagnosis and treatment of MR. A key project element was a set of surveys distributed to primary care and cardiovascular physicians (cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons). Survey and other gap analysis findings were presented to a panel of 10 expert advisors from specialties of general cardiology, cardiac imaging, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgeons with expertise in valvular heart disease, especially MR, and cardiovascular education. The panel was charged with assessing the relative importance and potential means of remedying identified gaps to improve care for patients with MR. The survey results identified several knowledge and practice gaps that may limit implementation of evidence-based recommendations for MR care. Specifically, half of primary care physicians reported uncertainty regarding timing of intervention for patients with severe primary or functional MR. Physicians in all groups reported that quantitative indices of MR severity were frequently not reported in clinical echocardiographic interpretations, and that these measurements were not consistently reviewed when provided in reports. In the treatment of MR, nearly 30% of primary care physician and general cardiologists did not know the volume of mitral valve repair surgeries by their reference cardiac surgeons and did not have a standard source to obtain this information. After review of the survey results, the expert panel summarized practice gaps into 4 thematic areas and offered proposals to address deficiencies and promote better alignment with the 2014 ACC/American Heart Association valvular disease guidelines.

Previous studies in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement may not be applicable in the present era of valve repair. We performed exercise echocardiography in 139 patients with isolated mitral regurgitation and no coronary disease, 74 of whom subsequently underwent uncomplicated valve repair. We measured rest left ventricular end-systolic dimension, end-systolic wall stress and positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt). End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction were measured preoperatively at rest, immediately after exercise and postoperatively. Ejection fraction decreased postoperatively to 55 +/- 10% from a rest preoperative value of 64 +/- 9% (p < 0.001). Compared with patients with a postoperative ejection fraction > or = (n = 56), patients with postoperative ejection fraction < 50% (n = 18) had a significantly lower preoperative exercise ejection fraction (57 +/- 11% vs. 73 +/- 9%, p < 0.0005), a larger exercise end-systolic volume index (32 +/- 8 vs. 18 +/- 7 cm3/m2, p < 0.0005) and a lower change in ejection fraction with exercise (-4 +/- 8% vs. 9 +/- 10%, p < 0.005). Preoperative rest indexes, including dP/dt, end-systolic wall stress and end-systolic volume index were less predictive, whereas exercise capacity, rest ejection fraction and end-systolic dimension were not predictive of post-repair ejection fraction.

When remodeling and enlargement of the left ventricle (LV) cause annular dilatation and tethering of the mitral valve leaflets, there is a linear relationship between LV end-diastolic volume and the effective regurgitant orifice area of the mitral valve. These patients, designated as having proportionate MR, respond favorably to treatments that lead to reversal of LV remodeling and a decrease in LV volumes (eg, neurohormonal antagonists and LV assist devices), but they may not benefit from interventions that are directed only at the mitral valve leaflets (eg, transcatheter mitral valve repair). In contrast, when ventricular dyssynchrony causes functional MR attributable to unequal contraction of the papillary muscles, the magnitude of regurgitation is greater than that predicted by LV volumes. These patients, designated as having severe but disproportionate MR, respond favorably to treatments that are directed to the mitral valve leaflets or their supporting structures (eg, cardiac resynchronization or transcatheter mitral valve repair), but they may derive little benefit from interventions that act only to reduce LV cavity size (eg, pharmacological treatments).

We propose that patients with secondary MR represent a heterogenous group, which can be usefully subdivided based on understanding that the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) is dependent on left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV). According to the Gorlin hydraulic orifice equation, patients with heart failure, an LV ejection fraction of 30%, an LVEDV of 220 to 250 ml, and a regurgitant fraction of 50% would be expected to have an EROA of ≈0.3 cm<sup>2</sup> independent of specific tethering abnormalities of the mitral valve leaflets. The MR in these patients is proportionate to the degree of LV dilatation and can respond to drugs and devices that reduce LVEDV. In contrast, patients with EROA of 0.3 to 0.4 cm<sup>2</sup> but with LVEDV of only 160 to 200 ml exhibit degrees of MR that are disproportionately higher than predicted by LVEDV. These patients appear to preferentially benefit from interventions directed at the mitral valve. Our proposed conceptual framework explains the apparently discordant results from 2 recent randomized controlled trials of mitral valve repair. The MITRA-FR (Percutaneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation) trial enrolled patients who had MR that was proportionate to the degree of LV dilatation, and during long-term follow-up, the LVEDV and clinical outcomes of these patients did not differ from medically-treated control subjects. In comparison, the patients enrolled in the COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trial had an EROA ≈30% higher but LV volumes that were ≈30% smaller, indicative of disproportionate MR. In these patients, transcatheter mitral valve repair reduced the risk of death and hospitalization for heart failure, and these benefits were paralleled by a meaningful decrease in LVEDV. Thus, characterization of MR as proportionate or disproportionate to LVEDV appears to be critical to the selection of an optimal treatment for patients with chronic heart failure and systolic dysfunction.",success

Three-dimensional TTE was less sensitive and less accurate in identifying flail segments. All modalities were equally reliable in identifying functional MR.

The author explores the possibility that left atrial remodeling may also play a role in the pathogenesis of ischemic MR, through a novel mechanism: atriogenic leaflet tethering. When ischemic MR is hemodynamically significant, the left ventricle compensates by dilating to preserve forward output using the Starling mechanism. Left ventricular dilatation, however, worsens MR by increasing the mitral valve regurgitant orifice, leading to a vicious cycle in which MR begets more MR. The author proposes that several structural adaptations play a role in reducing ischemic MR. In contrast to the compensatory effects of left ventricular enlargement, these may reduce, rather than increase, its severity. The suggested adaptations involve the mitral valve leaflets, the papillary muscles, the mitral annulus, and the left ventricular false tendons. This review describes the potential role each may play in reducing ischemic MR. Therapies that exploit these adaptations are also discussed.",success

Mid-late systolic MR versus holosystolic MR groups were well matched, including for comorbidity, blood pressure, and heart rate (all P>0.10).

MR of mitral valve prolapse that is purely mid-late systolic causes more benign consequences and outcomes than holosystolic MR. Assessment may be misleading because jet area and ERO by flow convergence appear similar to those of holosystolic MR.

Using a circulatory loop with an incorporated imaging chamber, various pulsatile flow rates of MR were driven through 4 differently sized orifices. In a clinical study of patients with at least mild MR, regurgitation severity was assessed quantitatively using Doppler-derived effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA), and semiquantitatively as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography. We describe a step-by-step process to accurately identify the 3D-VC area and compare that measure against known orifice areas (in vitro study) and EROA (clinical study). In vitro, 3D-VC area demonstrated the strongest correlation with known orifice area (r = 0.92, p < 0.001), whereas 2D-VC diameter had a weak correlation with orifice area (r = 0.56, p = 0.01). In a clinical study of 61 patients, 3D-VC area correlated with Doppler-derived EROA (r = 0.85, p < 0.001); the relation was stronger than for 2D-VC diameter (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). The advantage of 3D-VC area over 2D-VC diameter was more pronounced in eccentric jets (r = 0.87, p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.6, p < 0.001, respectively) and in moderate-to-severe or severe MR (r = 0.80, p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.18, p = 0.4, respectively).

Accurate grading of MR severity is crucial for appropriate patient management but remains challenging. VE-CMR with 3D three-directional acquisition has been recently proposed as the reference method. A total of 64 patients with functional MR were included. A VE-CMR acquisition was applied to quantify mitral regurgitant volume (Rvol). Color Doppler 3D echocardiography was applied for direct measurement, in ""en face"" view, of mitral effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA); Rvol was subsequently calculated as EROA multiplied by the velocity-time integral of the regurgitant jet on the continuous-wave Doppler. To assess the relative potential error of the conventional approach, color Doppler 2-dimensional (2D) echocardiography was performed: vena contracta width was measured in the 4-chamber view and EROA calculated as circular (EROA-4CH); EROA was also calculated as elliptical (EROA-elliptical), measuring vena contracta also in the 2-chamber view. From these 2D measurements of EROA, the Rvols were also calculated. The EROA measured by 3D echocardiography was significantly higher than EROA-4CH (p < 0.001) and EROA-elliptical (p < 0.001), with a significant bias between these measurements (0.10 cm(2) and 0.06 cm(2), respectively). Rvol measured by 3D echocardiography showed excellent correlation with Rvol measured by CMR (r = 0.94), without a significant difference between these techniques (mean difference = -0.08 ml/beat). Conversely, 2D echocardiographic approach from the 4-chamber view significantly underestimated Rvol (p = 0.006) as compared with CMR (mean difference = 2.9 ml/beat). The 2D elliptical approach demonstrated a better agreement with CMR (mean difference = -1.6 ml/beat, p = 0.04).

Using PISA provides measures of MRFR, but calculating MRSV is challenging because of dynamic variations in the flow profile dependent on the underlying mechanism of mitral regurgitation (MR). Although various single-point and time-integral approaches have been described to overcome this limitation, uncertainty exists about the accuracy and feasibility of these methods in routine clinical practice. In 73 patients with MR of different etiologies, MRSV was calculated from an apical 4-chamber view using the following 4 hemispheric PISA methods: 1) PISA-velocity-time integral (VTI) = midsystolic MRFR by PISA x regurgitant flow VTI/peak velocity; 2) simplified PISA = midsystolic MRFR/3.25; 3) serial PISA = sum of instantaneous MRFRs over serial 2-dimensional frames; and 4) M-mode PISA = time-integral of MRFRs from color M-mode. The MRSV by MRI was calculated from mitral inflow minus aortic outflow. Single-point PISA methods yielded greater underestimation of MRSV (mean error: -13.3 +/- 10.2 ml [PISA-VTI]; -13.5 +/- 10.3 ml [simplified PISA]), particularly in functional MR, compared with time-integral PISA methods accounting for variations of MRFR and EROA over time (mean error: -8.0 +/- 6.4 ml [M-mode PISA]; -8.7 +/- 7.4 ml [serial PISA]).

Velocity-encoded cine NMR imaging has been reported to provide accurate measurement of the volume of blood flow in the ascending aorta and through the mitral annulus. Therefore, we hypothesized that the difference between mitral inflow and aortic systolic flow provides the regurgitant volume in the setting of mitral regurgitation. Using velocity-encoded cine NMR imaging at a magnet field strength of 1.5 T and color Doppler echocardiography, 19 patients with isolated mitral regurgitation and 10 normal subjects were studied. Velocity-encoded cine NMR images were acquired in the short-axis plane of the ascending aorta and from the short-axis plane of the left ventricle at the level of the mitral annulus. Two independent observers measured the ascending aortic flow volume and left ventricular inflow volume to calculate the regurgitant volume as the difference between left ventricular inflow volume and aortic flow volume, and the regurgitant fraction was calculated. Using accepted criteria of color flow Doppler imaging and spectral analysis, the severity of mitral regurgitation was qualitatively graded as mild, moderate or severe and compared with regurgitant volume and regurgitant fraction, as determined by velocity-encoded cine NMR imaging. In normal subjects the regurgitant volume was -6 +/- 345 ml/min (mean +/- SD). In patients with mild, moderate and severe mitral regurgitation, the regurgitant volume was 156 +/- 203, 1,384 +/- 437 and 4,763 +/- 2,449 ml/min, respectively.

This paper reviews hydrodynamic determinants of MR severity, showing that EROA and RVol values associated with severe MR depend on LV volume. This explains disparities in the evidence associating a lower EROA threshold with suboptimal survival. Redefining MR severity purely on EROA or RVol may cause significant clinical problems.

Utilizing The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD), a multivariable model was created that included patient clinical characteristics and surgeon-specific mitral volume to predict the likelihood of mitral valve repair. Between January 2005 and December 2007, 28,507 patients undergoing isolated mitral valve surgery (with or without tricuspid valve surgery, with or without atrial fibrillation surgery) by 1,088 surgeons at 639 hospitals in the STS ACSD were identified. Patient characteristics independently associated with mitral valve repair were identified using a generalized estimating equations logistic regression model. Observed mitral valve repair rates were plotted against surgeon-specific annual mitral volume, and predicted probabilities of mitral repair by surgeon volume were calculated after adjusting for patient baseline covariates. On average, patients undergoing mitral valve surgery were 62 years old, with 51% female and 82% Caucasian. Among surgeons performing mitral procedures, the mean rate of mitral valve repair was 41% (range, 0% to 100%) and the median number of mitral valve operations per year was 5 (range, 1 to 166). Several patient characteristics were independently associated with a decreased odds of mitral repair (versus replacement), including mitral stenosis (odds ratio 0.09; 95% confidence interval: 0.08 to 0.11) and active endocarditis (odds ratio 0.21; 95% confidence interval: 0.17 to 0.25). While substantial variability in repair rates was observed among low-volume surgeons, increased surgeon-level mitral volume was independently associated with an increased probability of mitral repair. This analysis demonstrates marked variability in the frequency of mitral valve repair, and the influence of both patient- and surgeon-level factors on the likelihood of mitral valve repair. Increasing surgeon-specific annual mitral valve volume is associated with a higher probability of mitral repair. Identification of these predictors of mitral valve repair creates substantial opportunity for quality improvement in patient outcomes in mitral valve surgery, potentially through education, adoption of best practices, and improved mitral repair enabling technology.",success

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding mitral valve repair to coronary artery bypass grafting on clinical outcomes and left ventricular remodeling in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting alone versus coronary artery bypass grafting plus mitral valve repair in a randomized trial. Between February 2003 and May 2007, 102 patients were eligible for this study and were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups by means of card allocation: coronary artery bypass grafting plus mitral valve repair (CABG plus MVR group; 48 patients, 47%) or coronary artery bypass grafting alone (CABG group; 54 patients, 53%). The 2 groups were similar regarding demographics, perioperative clinical data, and outcomes. There were differences regarding cardiopulmonary bypass (P < .0001) and aortic crossclamp (P < .0001) times. Exercise tests were performed for all survivors to evaluate tolerance to exercise and variability on grade of mitral regurgitation and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure. The study was blinded for physicians and nurses involved in postoperative care and clinical follow-up. The mean follow-up was 32 +/- 18 months. Overall in-hospital mortality was 3% (3 patients). One (1.8%) patient died in the CABG group, and 2 (4.1%) patients died in the CABG plus MVR group. Survival rates +/- standard error at 5 years for patients in the CABG and CABG plus MVR groups were 88.8% +/- 3.2% and 93.7% +/- 3.1%, respectively. A significant difference was found between the 2 groups with regard to mean New York Heart Association class (P < .0001), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P < .01), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (P < .01), pulmonary arterial pressure (P < .0001), and left atrial size (P < .01). At follow-up, coronary artery bypass grafting alone was able to reduce mitral regurgitation grade in 40% of patients, whereas in the remaining patients mitral regurgitation grade remained stable or worsened. In the CABG group, among the 17 patients with mild mitral regurgitation and 12 patients with moderate mitral regurgitation at rest, 7 (40%) and 9 (75%) patients, respectively, had worsening in mitral regurgitation grade and pulmonary artery pressure during exercise. The efficacy of adding mitral valve repair to coronary artery bypass grafting is well demonstrated by the improvement of New York Heart Association functional class and percentage of left ventricular ejection fraction and by the decrease of mitral regurgitation grade, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, pulmonary artery pressure, and left atrial size. Moreover, coronary artery bypass grafting alone left more patients with heart failure symptoms at rest and during exercise. Combined coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve repair have no effect on survival at short-term follow-up, and the trends that are evident will likely become more significant with time.",success

Recent studies have documented a significant number of patients are not referred in a timely fashion according to established guidelines, and when they are subjected to surgery, an alarming number of patients continue to undergo mitral valve replacement. The debate around appropriate timing of intervention for asymptomatic severe mitral valve regurgitation has put additional emphasis on targeted surgeon referral and the need to ensure a very high rate of mitral valve repair, particularly in the non-elderly population.

Multivariate analysis of post-repair MR recurrence employed Cox proportional hazards and multistate modeling. A total of 1,218 patients met the study criteria; the mean age was 64 ± 13 years, mean ejection fraction was 63 ± 9%, and 864 (71%) patients were men. Prolapse was posterior in 62%, bileaflet in 26%, and anterior in 12%. The 15-year incidence of recurrent MR (i.e., MR ≥2) was 13.3%, incidence of mitral reoperation was 6.9%, and overall mortality was 44.0%. Repair before 1996 independently predicted MR recurrence (hazard ratio: 1.52). Additional determinants were: age, mild intraoperative residual MR, anterior leaflet prolapse, bileaflet prolapse, perfusion time >90 min, and lack of annuloplasty. Recurrence of moderate or greater MR was associated with adverse left ventricular remodeling and increased likelihood of death (hazard ratio: 1.72). Among those undergoing repair after 1996, MR recurrence rate was 1.5 per 100 patient-years during the first year post-repair, decreasing markedly to 0.9 thereafter.

That is most often accomplished through the use of risk models that account for preoperative patient factors that may impact outcomes. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) uses such risk models to create risk-adjusted performance reports for participants in the STS National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (NCD). Although risk models were initially developed for coronary artery bypass surgery, similar models have now been developed for use with heart valve surgery, particularly as the proportion of such procedures has increased. The last published STS model for isolated valve surgery was based on data from 1994 to 1997 and did not include patients undergoing mitral valve repair. STS has developed new valve surgery models using contemporary data that include both valve repair as well as replacement. Expanding upon existing valve models, the new STS models include several nonfatal complications in addition to mortality. Using STS data from 2002 to 2006, isolated valve surgery risk models were developed for operative mortality, permanent stroke, renal failure, prolonged ventilation (> 24 hours), deep sternal wound infection, reoperation for any reason, a major morbidity or mortality composite endpoint, prolonged postoperative length of stay, and short postoperative length of stay. The study population consisted of adult patients who underwent one of three types of valve surgery: isolated aortic valve replacement (n = 67,292), isolated mitral valve replacement (n = 21,229), or isolated mitral valve repair (n = 21,238). The population was divided into a 60% development sample and a 40% validation sample. After an initial empirical investigation, the three surgery groups were combined into a single logistic regression model with numerous interactions to allow the covariate effects to differ across these groups. Variables were selected based on a combination of automated stepwise selection and expert panel review. Unadjusted operative mortality (in-hospital regardless of timing, and 30-day regardless of venue) for all isolated valve procedures was 3.4%, and unadjusted in-hospital morbidity rates ranged from 0.3% for deep sternal wound infection to 11.8% for prolonged ventilation. The number of predictors in each model ranged from 10 covariates in the sternal infection model to 24 covariates in the composite mortality plus morbidity model. Discrimination as measured by the c-index ranged from 0.639 for reoperation to 0.799 for mortality. When patients in the validation sample were grouped into 10 categories based on deciles of predicted risk, the average absolute difference between observed versus predicted events within these groups ranged from 0.06% for deep sternal wound infection to 1.06% for prolonged postoperative stay. The new STS risk models for valve surgery include mitral valve repair as well as multiple endpoints other than mortality.

To delineate and help select areas where comparative effectiveness reviews are needed, the Effective Health Care Program of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality involved stakeholders in prioritization of the research agenda. We involved a diverse panel of stakeholders representing a broad range of clinical, policy, and patient perspectives. To assist in prioritization of topics for evidence synthesis, we created a framework evaluating 12 cardiovascular disease subcategories that reflect American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association disease-based guidelines. We performed an environmental scan for each disease subcategory to populate this framework with existing knowledge, levels of evidence, and degrees of public interest. Through a formalized process, 4 disease subcategories were prioritized: chronic coronary artery disease, ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease. Within these subcategories, 11 topics that address the comparative safety and effectiveness of existing treatments and evaluate emerging treatments were nominated by the stakeholder panel to proceed for feasibility assessment before developing comparative effectiveness reviews. Using a systematic process deriving consensus from multiple stakeholders across cardiovascular disease states, we generated a prioritized list of evidence synthesis topics to inform decision makers. The topics vetted through this process seek to determine the comparative safety and effectiveness of a range of treatments, both established and emerging, and are immediately relevant for prevalent disease states.",success

The patients were categorized in three groups: those with an ejection fraction of less than 40 percent (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction), those with an ejection fraction of 40 to 50 percent (heart failure with borderline ejection fraction), and those with an ejection fraction of more than 50 percent (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). Two groups were studied in detail: those with an ejection fraction of less than 40 percent and those with an ejection fraction of more than 50 percent. The main outcome measures were death within one year and readmission to the hospital for heart failure. Thirty-one percent of the patients had an ejection fraction of more than 50 percent. Patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction were more likely to be older and female and to have a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. The presenting history and clinical examination findings were similar for the two groups. The unadjusted mortality rates for patients with an ejection fraction of more than 50 percent were not significantly different from those for patients with an ejection fraction of less than 40 percent at 30 days (5 percent vs. 7 percent, P=0.08) and at 1 year (22 percent vs. 26 percent, P=0.07); the adjusted one-year mortality rates were also not significantly different in the two groups (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.36; P=0.18).

The cause of this injury is uncertain but is suspected to be related to myocarditis, microvascular injury, systemic cytokine-mediated injury, or stress-related cardiomyopathy. Although histologically unproven, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has the potential to directly replicate within cardiomyocytes and pericytes, leading to viral myocarditis. Systemically elevated cytokines are also known to be cardiotoxic and have the potential to result in profound myocardial injury. Prior experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 has helped expedite the evaluation of several promising therapies, including antiviral agents, interleukin-6 inhibitors, and convalescent serum.

We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -a homologue of ACE-to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications. Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk.

It begins by discussing the importance of population-level risk assessment of heart disease in light of the growth rate of specific minority populations in the U.S. It describes the population-level dynamics for racial and ethnic minorities: a higher overall prevalence of risk factors for coronary artery disease that are unrecognized and therefore not treated, which increases their likelihood of experiencing adverse outcome and, therefore, potentially higher morbidity and mortality. It discusses the rate of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in minority communities. Minority patients with ACS are at greater risk of myocardial infarction (MI), rehospitalization, and death from ACS. They also are less likely than non-minority patients to receive potentially beneficial treatments such as angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention. This paper looks at the data surrounding the increased rate of heart disease in racial and ethnic minorities, where the risk is related to the prevalence of comorbidities with hypertension or diabetes mellitus, which, in combination with environmental factors, may largely explain CHF disparity. The conclusion is that it is essential that healthcare providers understand these various communities, including nuances in disease presentation, risk factors, and treatment among different racial and ethnic groups.

We used a systematic literature review methodology to find articles from the top 50 highest-impact journals in each of 6 categories (249 journals in total) that most closely represented the public health field, were published during 2002-2015, were US focused, were indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE and/or Ovid/MEDLINE, and mentioned terms relating to institutionalized racism in their titles or abstracts. We analyzed the content of these articles for the use of related terms and concepts. We found only 25 articles that named institutionalized racism in the title or abstract among all articles published in the public health literature during 2002-2015 in the 50 highest-impact journals and 6 categories representing the public health field in the United States. Institutionalized racism was a core concept in 16 of the 25 articles. Although institutionalized racism is recognized as a fundamental cause of health inequities, it was not often explicitly named in the titles or abstracts of articles published in the public health literature during 2002-2015. Our results highlight the need to explicitly name institutionalized racism in articles in the public health literature and to make it a central concept in inequities research. More public health research on institutionalized racism could help efforts to overcome its substantial, longstanding effects on health and well-being.",success

These systems, in turn, are responsible for either successful adaptation or pathophysiology as a result of the cumulative burden of adaptation to stress and maladaptive lifestyle, which is known as ""allostatic load."" The brain itself is also a target of stress and stress-related hormones, and it undergoes structural and functional remodeling and significant changes in gene expression. These changes are adaptive under normal circumstances but can lead to damage when stress is excessive. The growing recognition of the adaptive plasticity and stress vulnerability of the brain itself, which began with research on the hippocampus, now includes other brain regions such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex and fear-related memories, working memory, and self-regulatory behaviors. The interactions between these brain regions during the biological embedding of experiences over the life course determines whether events in the social and physical environment will lead to successful adaptation or to maladaptation and impaired mental and physical health, with implications for understanding health disparities and the impact of early life adversity and for intervention and prevention strategies.",success

The implications of these school closures with regard to the number of African American medical school graduates have not been fully examined. To examine the consequences associated with the closure of historically Black medical schools for the number of African American medical school graduates. This observational economic evaluation used steady expansion and rapid expansion models to estimate the consequences associated with the closure of historically Black medical schools for the number of African American medical school graduates. The numbers of graduates from 13 historically Black medical schools that are now closed were obtained through historical records. Data on historically Black medical schools that are currently open were obtained from school-specific reports and reports published by the Association of American Medical Colleges. The study focused on projected estimates of outcomes from the hypothetical continued operation and expansion of 5 closed historically Black medical schools that were included in the Flexner report: Flint Medical College of New Orleans University, Knoxville Medical College, Leonard Medical School of Shaw University, Louisville National Medical College, and the University of West Tennessee College of Medicine and Surgery-Memphis. The main outcome was the estimate of the number of African American students who would have graduated from historically Black medical schools that were closed during the period surrounding the 1910 Flexner report. Among the 5 historically Black medical schools that were closed, the estimated mean number of graduates per year was 5.27 students at Flint Medical College, 2.60 students at Knoxville Medical College, 11.06 students at Leonard Medical School, 4.17 students at Louisville National Medical College, and 6.74 students at the University of West Tennessee. If the 5 closed historically Black medical schools had remained open, the steady expansion and rapid expansion models indicated that these schools might have collectively provided training to an additional 27 773 graduates and 35 315 graduates, respectively, between their year of closure and 2019. In the analysis of Leonard Medical School and the University of West Tennessee only, the steady expansion and rapid expansion models indicated that these 2 schools would have provided training to an additional 10 587 graduates and 13 403 graduates, respectively, between their year of closure and 2019. An extrapolation based on the racial and ethnic self-identification of current graduates of historically Black medical schools indicated that if these closed schools had remained open, the number of graduating African American physicians might have increased by 355 individuals (29%) in 2019 alone. To increase the number of African American medical school graduates, consideration should be given to creating medical education programs at historically Black colleges and universities.

Hypertension in particular is highly prevalent among African Americans and contributes directly to the notable disparities in stroke, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease among African Americans. Despite the availability of effective pharmacotherapies and indications for some tailored pharmacotherapies for African Americans (eg, heart failure medications), disease management is less effective among African Americans, yielding higher mortality.

In May 2006, a symposium was held to discuss the validity of the formula for survival hypothesis and to investigate the influence of each of the multiplicands on survival. This commentary combines the output from this symposium with an updated illustration of the three multiplicands in the FfS using rapid response systems (RRS) for medical science, therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for local implementation, and bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for educational efficiency. International differences between hospital systems made it difficult to assign a precise value for the multiplicand medical science using RRS as an example. Using bystander CPR as an example for the multiplicand educational efficiency, it was also difficult to provide a precise value, mainly because of differences between compression-only and standard CPR.

Resuscitations attended by a team of NRP certified providers had improved sequencing when compared with those in which only some individual providers were certified. Chest compressions were provided in 8% of the cases (65 of 783). Medications were used in 14% (113/783) of all cases. Providers in level I hospitals performed chest compressions more frequently than those in level II and III settings. At the end of the resuscitation, 27% of the infants were hypothermic (142 of 520), and 25% were hyperthermic (128 of 520). Overall, 52% were out of the normal neutral range. Clear differences between the NRP guidelines and actual clinical practice were shown. A high rate of unanticipated resuscitations, delivery room medications, and chest compressions was described. Postresuscitation hypothermia or hyperthermia were common. Improved sequencing was noted when the entire resuscitation team was NRP certified.

The Apgar score continues to be used as the best established index of immediate postnatal health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the NRP instruction in Illinois hospitals by examining Apgar scores among high-risk infants who are likely to benefit from the NRP. A retrospective 3-time period cohort design was used (before the introduction of the NRP, 1985-1988; transition when NRP training occurred, 1989-1990; and after NRP training was completed at least once for some delivery room personnel in each Illinois hospital, 1991-1995). Illinois computerized birth certificate files on a selected group of 636 429 high-risk neonates provided information on Apgar scores and maternal characteristics. The American Academy of Pediatrics provided instructor lists to determine when NRP training started and when it was fully implemented in Illinois. Illinois Department of Public Health provided data to categorize hospitals into levels based on type and intensity of neonatal services (Level I, II, II+, III). High-risk neonates were defined as meeting 1 of the following criteria: maternal age <20 years old or >35 years old, birth weight <2500 g or >4000 g, presence of a maternal medical risk factor, and no prenatal care or prenatal care started after the first trimester. Several exclusion criteria were applied including the following: birth records with missing data, multiple birth or congenital anomaly, and hospital information that indicate no birth deliveries in 1 of the 11 study years or delivery outside of a hospital. One-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were divided into categories for analysis (0-3, 4-6, 7-10). No change or a decrease in a low (0-6) 1-minute Apgar when compared with the 5-minute Apgar was a primary measure to evaluate effect of NRP resuscitation. Variables examined included the following: race/ethnicity, maternal age, level of education, presence of maternal medical risk factor, trimester started prenatal care, complications of labor and delivery, and a low birth weight. Analysis consisted of chi(2) tests, relative risk calculations, and logistic regression to reveal independent associations with no change in low 1-minute Apgar score or continued low (0-6) 5-minute Apgar. A total of 636 429 high-risk birth records was selected for detailed analyses out of 2 077 533 births in Illinois between 1985 and 1995 for 193 hospitals. The number of active NRP instructors in Illinois changed dramatically during the study period; for example, 1 to 6 between 1987 and 1988 to 1096 to 1242 between 1991 and 1995. The percentage of neonates reported to have low (<7) 1-minute Apgar score decreased in 1991 to 1995 overall and for each of 4 hospital levels. Overall and by hospital level, there was a statistically significant lower proportion of high-risk newborns who showed a decrease or no change in their 5-minute Apgar scores after the NRP instruction. After adjusting for several maternal characteristics, logistic regression analysis revealed that high-risk newborns with a low 1-minute Apgar were more likely to increase their 5-minute Apgar after the NRP instruction in 1991 to 1995. Additional analyses indicated that very low birth weight and low birth weight newborns benefited the most from NRP instruction. Although previous research has shown that the NRP instruction improves knowledge and skill among health care personnel in the delivery room, both short-term and long-term, there has been little evidence to demonstrate NRP impact on infant morbidity. Several strategies were used in this study to control for bias and to adjust for secular trends in decreased infant morbidity during the study period.

Placental transfusion may improve circulating volume at birth, which may in turn improve outcome for preterm infants. To assess the short- and long-term effects of early rather than delaying clamping or milking of the umbilical cord for infants born at less than 37 completed weeks' gestation, and their mothers.

Delaying cord clamping was associated with fewer infants requiring transfusions for anaemia (seven trials, 392 infants; risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.81), less intraventricular haemorrhage (ultrasound diagnosis all grades) 10 trials, 539 infants (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) and lower risk for necrotising enterocolitis (five trials, 241 infants, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.90) compared with immediate clamping. However, the peak bilirubin concentration was higher for infants allocated to delayed cord clamping compared with immediate clamping (seven trials, 320 infants, mean difference 15.01 mmol/L, 95% CI 5.62 to 24.40).

All neonates born ≥39 weeks' gestation born through elective CS were assigned to either the DCC or the ECC arm at a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated, randomized sequence. The primary outcome was the hematocrit at day 2 of life. Secondary outcomes included: preductal oxygen saturation and heart rate during the first 10 min of life; transcutaneous bilirubin at day 3; and neonatal blood pressures in the first 3 days of life. Additional outcomes included: time to first spontaneous breath; temperature at admission to normal nursery; weight at discharge; and maternal blood losses. Eighty neonates were randomized to the DCC (n = 40) or the ECC (n = 40) arm. The hematocrit at day 2 was significantly higher in the DCC arm than in the ECC arm (mean difference: 6%; 95% CI 3-8; p < 0.0001). The secondary outcome measures were not statistically different between the two arms. No infants needed phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia during their hospital stay.

Using PubMed as our principal electronic reference library, we searched studies for prevalence and risk factor data on neonatal hypothermia in resource-limited environments globally. Studies specifying study location, setting (hospital or community based), sample size, case definition of body temperature for hypothermia, temperature measurement method, and point estimates for hypothermia prevalence were eligible for inclusion. Hypothermia is common in infants born at hospitals (prevalence range, 32% to 85%) and homes (prevalence range, 11% to 92%), even in tropical environments. The lack of thermal protection is still an underappreciated major challenge for newborn survival in developing countries. Although hypothermia is rarely a direct cause of death, it contributes to a substantial proportion of neonatal mortality globally, mostly as a comorbidity of severe neonatal infections, preterm birth, and asphyxia. Thresholds for the definition of hypothermia vary, and data on its prevalence in neonates is scarce, particularly on a community level in Africa. A standardized approach to the collection and analysis of hypothermia data in existing newborn programs and studies is needed to inform policy and program planners on optimal thermal protection interventions. Thermoprotective behavior changes such as skin-to-skin care or the use of appropriate devices have not yet been scaled up globally. The introduction of simple hypothermia prevention messages and interventions into evidence-based, cost-effective packages for maternal and newborn care has promising potential to decrease the heavy global burden of newborn deaths attributable to severe infections, prematurity, and asphyxia.

Ninety-eight neonatal cases in three Nigerian tertiary-care hospitals were retrospectively recruited; on the basis of birthweight  < 1500 g, this number was reduced to 41 for a two-stage analysis. In the first stage, 34 cases recruited over 24 months were analysed. In the second stage, seven cases recruited over 6 months were analysed; these were neonates managed with a new temperature control technique (the 'handy approach') to enable comparison of outcomes. The mean (SD) birthweight of the infants analysed was 991 g (251), and 28 of them were of extremely low-birthweight (ELBW) [mean (SD) 846 g (128)]. A lifetime temperature plot with a clearly visible reference zone was developed, from which all thermal stresses and their duration associated with mortality were identified and defined on the basis of their characteristics. Methods of quantifying the magnitude and duration of these thermal stresses were devised to enable definition of critical values. This was then applied to calculate a measure of the various thermal stresses which may have contributed to neonatal death. Hypothermic events were very common in all the infants in the study period, but were not significantly associated with mortality. However, hyperthermic events occurred in 35% of the infants and were more likely to be associated with mortality. Most neonates with prolonged hypothermia culminating in rapid hyperthermia survived. However, all ELBW neonates who experienced prolonged hyperthermia culminating in rapid hypothermia died within 8 hours of the event.

In standard hospital care, newborn infants are held wrapped or dressed in their mother's arms, placed in open cribs or under radiant warmers. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) begins ideally at birth and should last continually until the end of the first breastfeeding. SSC involves placing the dried, naked baby prone on the mother's bare chest, often covered with a warm blanket. According to mammalian neuroscience, the intimate contact inherent in this place (habitat) evokes neuro-behaviors ensuring fulfillment of basic biological needs. This time frame immediately post birth may represent a 'sensitive period' for programming future physiology and behavior. To assess the effects of immediate or early SSC for healthy newborn infants compared to standard contact on establishment and maintenance of breastfeeding and infant physiology. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (17 December 2015), made personal contact with trialists, consulted the bibliography on kangaroo mother care (KMC) maintained by Dr Susan Ludington, and reviewed reference lists of retrieved studies. Randomized controlled trials that compared immediate or early SSC with usual hospital care. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. We included 46 trials with 3850 women and their infants; 38 trials with 3472 women and infants contributed data to our analyses. Trials took place in 21 countries, and most recruited small samples (just 12 trials randomized more than 100 women). Eight trials included women who had SSC after cesarean birth. All infants recruited to trials were healthy, and the majority were full term. Six trials studied late preterm infants (greater than 35 weeks' gestation). No included trial met all criteria for good quality with respect to methodology and reporting; no trial was successfully blinded, and all analyses were imprecise due to small sample size. Many analyses had statistical heterogeneity due to considerable differences between SSC and standard care control groups. Results for womenSSC women were more likely than women with standard contact to be breastfeeding at one to four months post birth, though there was some uncertainty in this estimate due to risks of bias in included trials (average risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.43; participants = 887; studies = 14; I² = 41%; GRADE: moderate quality). SSC women also breast fed their infants longer, though data were limited (mean difference (MD) 64 days, 95% CI 37.96 to 89.50; participants = 264; studies = six; GRADE:low quality); this result was from a sensitivity analysis excluding one trial contributing all of the heterogeneity in the primary analysis. SSC women were probably more likely to exclusively breast feed from hospital discharge to one month post birth and from six weeks to six months post birth, though both analyses had substantial heterogeneity (from discharge average RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.49; participants = 711; studies = six; I² = 44%; GRADE: moderate quality; from six weeks average RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.90; participants = 640; studies = seven; I² = 62%; GRADE: moderate quality).Women in the SCC group had higher mean scores for breastfeeding effectiveness, with moderate heterogeneity (IBFAT (Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool) score MD 2.28, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.15; participants = 384; studies = four; I² = 41%). SSC infants were more likely to breast feed successfully during their first feed, with high heterogeneity (average RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.67; participants = 575; studies = five; I² = 85%). Results for infantsSSC infants had higher SCRIP (stability of the cardio-respiratory system) scores overall, suggesting better stabilization on three physiological parameters. However, there were few infants, and the clinical significance of the test was unclear because trialists reported averages of multiple time points (standardized mean difference (SMD) 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; participants = 81; studies = two; GRADE low quality). SSC infants had higher blood glucose levels (MD 10.49, 95% CI 8.39 to 12.59; participants = 144; studies = three; GRADE: low quality), but similar temperature to infants in standard care (MD 0.30 degree Celcius (°C) 95% CI 0.13 °C to 0.47 °C; participants = 558; studies = six; I² = 88%; GRADE: low quality). Women and infants after cesarean birthWomen practicing SSC after cesarean birth were probably more likely to breast feed one to four months post birth and to breast feed successfully (IBFAT score), but analyses were based on just two trials and few women. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether SSC could improve breastfeeding at other times after cesarean. Single trials contributed to infant respiratory rate, maternal pain and maternal state anxiety with no power to detect group differences. SubgroupsWe found no differences for any outcome when we compared times of initiation (immediate less than 10 minutes post birth versus early 10 minutes or more post birth) or lengths of contact time (60 minutes or less contact versus more than 60 minutes contact). Evidence supports the use of SSC to promote breastfeeding. Studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm physiological benefit for infants during transition to extra-uterine life and to establish possible dose-response effects and optimal initiation time. Methodological quality of trials remains problematic, and small trials reporting different outcomes with different scales and limited data limit our confidence in the benefits of SSC for infants. Our review included only healthy infants, which limits the range of physiological parameters observed and makes their interpretation difficult.",success

Recent randomized controlled studies have shown a reduction in admission hypothermia and an increase in the number of infants admitted with normal temperature (36.5-37.5°C) when heated humidified gases were used for initial stabilization of preterm infants. <b>Objective:</b> The goal of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of published randomized trials using heated humidified gas compared to cold dry gas in preterm infants immediately after birth and during transport to the neonatal unit. Specific research aims were to determine the magnitude of the reduction in hypothermia and to examine neonatal outcomes including mortality. <b>Methods:</b> A literature search was conducted in accordance with the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Work Group. Randomized trials were identified and data entered into RevMan5. A fixed effects statistical model was used. Risk of bias was assessed for included studies and the GRADE approach used to determine quality of evidence. The primary outcome was admission hypothermia (< 36.5°C). Secondary outcomes included admission temperature in the normothermic range (36.5-37.5°C) and neonatal outcomes including mortality. <b>Results:</b> Two studies met inclusion criteria and a total of 476 preterm infants were enrolled, all of whom were < 32 weeks gestation. Studies were not blinded but the overall risk of bias was low. Admission hypothermia was reduced by 36% (CI 17-50%), while admission normothermia was significantly increased. GRADE quality of evidence was high for these outcomes. The number of infants with more severe hypothermia (< 35.5°C) was significantly reduced (RR 0.32 CI 0.14-0.73). In addition, preterm infants < 28 weeks had significantly less admission hypothermia (RR 0.61 CI 0.42, 0.90) Mortality and measures of respiratory outcome were not significantly different (studies were not powered for these outcomes), though there was a trend to improvement in all respiratory measures assessed. There were no significant adverse events and no increase in admission hyperthermia (>37.5°C). <b>Conclusions:</b> Heating and humidification of inspired gases immediately after birth and during transport to the neonatal unit improves admission temperature in preterm infants.

Risk of hyperthermia on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth was increased in infants in the wrapped group (typical RR 3.91, 95% CI 2.05 to 7.44; typical RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 17 to 50; 12 studies; 1523 infants), but overall, fewer infants receiving plastic wrap were outside the normothermic range (typical RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81; typical RD -0.20, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.15; NNTH 5, 95% CI 4 to 7; five studies; 1048 infants).Evidence was insufficient to suggest that plastic wraps or bags significantly reduce risk of death during hospital stay or other major morbidities, with the exception of reducing risk of pulmonary haemorrhage.Evidence of practices regarding permutations on this general approach is still emerging and has been based on the findings of only one or two small studies.External heat sourcesEvidence is emerging on the efficacy of external heat sources, including skin-to-skin care (SSC) versus routine care (one study; 31 infants) and thermal mattress versus routine care (two studies; 126 infants).SSC was shown to be effective in reducing risk of hypothermia when compared with conventional incubator care for infants with birth weight ≥ 1200 and ≤ 2199 grams (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.64; RD -0.56, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.27; NNTB 2, 95% CI 1 to 4). Thermal (transwarmer) mattress significantly kept infants ≤ 1500 grams warmer (MD 0.65°C, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.94) and reduced the incidence of hypothermia on admission to the NICU, with no significant difference in hyperthermia risk.Combinations of interventionsTwo studies (77 infants) compared thermal mattresses versus plastic wraps or bags for infants at ≤ 28 weeks' gestation. Investigators reported no significant differences in core body temperature nor in the incidence of hypothermia, hyperthermia, or core body temperature outside the normothermic range on admission to the NICU.Two additional studies (119 infants) compared plastic bags and thermal mattresses versus plastic bags alone for infants at < 31 weeks' gestation. Meta-analysis of these two studies showed improvement in core body temperature on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth, but an increase in hyperthermia. Data show no significant difference in the risk of having a core body temperature outside the normothermic range on admission to the NICU nor in the risk of other reported morbidities. Evidence of moderate quality shows that use of plastic wraps or bags compared with routine care led to higher temperatures on admission to NICUs with less hypothermia, particularly for extremely preterm infants. Thermal mattresses and SSC also reduced hypothermia risk when compared with routine care, but findings are based on two or fewer small studies. Caution must be taken to avoid iatrogenic hyperthermia, particularly when multiple interventions are used simultaneously. Limited evidence suggests benefit and no evidence of harm for most short-term morbidity outcomes known to be associated with hypothermia, including major brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis, and nosocomial infection. Many observational studies have shown increased mortality among preterm hypothermic infants compared with those who maintain normothermia, yet evidence is insufficient to suggest that these interventions reduce risk of in-hospital mortality across all comparison groups. Hypothermia may be a marker for illness and poorer outcomes by association rather than by causality. Limitations of this review include small numbers of identified studies; small sample sizes; and variations in methods and definitions used for hypothermia, hyperthermia, normothermia, routine care, and morbidity, along with lack of power to detect effects on morbidity and mortality across most comparison groups. Future studies should: be adequately powered to detect rarer outcomes; apply standardised morbidity definitions; focus on longer-term outcomes, particularly neurodevelopmental outcomes.",success

Neonates randomized to plastic bag (n = 135) or to standard thermoregulation care (n = 136) had similar baseline characteristics (birth weight, gestational age, gender, and baseline temperature). Neonates in the plastic bag group had a lower rate of hypothermia (60% vs 73%, risk ratio 0.76, confidence interval 0.60-0.96, P = .026) and a higher axillary temperature (36.4 ± 0.5°C vs 36.2 ± 0.7°C, P < .001) at 1 hour after birth compared with infants receiving standard care. Placement in a plastic bag at birth reduced the incidence of hypothermia at 1 hour after birth in term neonates born in a resource-poor setting, but most neonates remained hypothermic.",success
26874298,True,Journal Article;Randomized Controlled Trial,,,,,,,,True,"Neonatal hypothermia is common at the time of cesarean delivery and has been associated with a constellation of morbidities in addition to increased neonatal mortality. Additionally, maternal hypothermia is often uncomfortable for the surgical patient and has been associated with intraoperative and postoperative complications. Various methods to decrease the rates of neonatal and maternal hypothermia have been examined and found to have varying levels of success. We sought to determine whether an increase in operating room temperature at cesarean delivery results in a decrease in the rate of neonatal hypothermia and associated morbidities. In this single-center randomized trial, operating room temperatures were adjusted weekly according to a cluster randomization schedule to either 20°C (67°F), which was the standard at our institution, or 23°C (73°F), which was the maximum temperature allowable per hospital policy. Neonatal hypothermia was defined as core body temperature <36.5°C (97.7°F) per World Health Organization criteria. The primary study outcome was neonatal hypothermia on arrival to the admitting nursery. Measures of neonatal morbidity potentially associated with hypothermia were examined. From February through July 2015, 791 women who underwent cesarean deliveries were enrolled, resulting in 410 infants in the 20°C standard management group and 399 in the 23°C study group. The rate of neonatal hypothermia on arrival to the admitting nursery was lower in the study group as compared to the standard management group: 35% vs 50%, P < .001. Moderate to severe hypothermia was infrequent when the operating room temperature was 23°C (5%); in contrast such hypothermia occurred in 19% of the standard management group, P < .001. Additionally, neonatal temperature in the operating room immediately following delivery and stabilization was also higher in the study group, 37.1 ± 0.6°C vs 36.9 ± 0.6°C, P < .001. We found no difference in rates of intubation, ventilator use, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidemia, or intraventricular hemorrhage. Fever (temperature >38.0°C or 100.4°F) on arrival to the admitting unit was uncommon and did not differ between the study groups. Maternal temperature on arrival to the operating room was not different between the 2 groups, however by delivery it was significantly lower in the standard management group, 36.2 ± 0.6°C vs 36.4 ± 0.6°C, P < .001. This effect persisted, as maternal temperature on arrival to the postoperative care area was lower in the standard management group, 36.1 ± 0.6°C vs 36.2 ± 0.6°C, P < .001, and the rate of hypothermia was higher, 77% vs 69%, P = .008. A modest increase in operating room temperature at the time of cesarean reduces the rate of neonatal and maternal hypothermia. We did not detect a decrease in neonatal morbidity, but the power to detect a small change in these outcomes was limited.",success

To determine whether evidence is available to support the use of KMC in LBW infants as an alternative to conventional neonatal care before or after the initial period of stabilization with conventional care, and to assess beneficial and adverse effects. We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. This included searches in CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; 2016, Issue 6), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), and POPLINE (Population Information Online) databases (all from inception to June 30, 2016), as well as the WHO (World Health Organization) Trial Registration Data Set (up to June 30, 2016). In addition, we searched the web page of the Kangaroo Foundation, conference and symposia proceedings on KMC, and Google Scholar. Randomized controlled trials comparing KMC versus conventional neonatal care, or early-onset KMC versus late-onset KMC, in LBW infants. Data collection and analysis were performed according to the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Twenty-one studies, including 3042 infants, fulfilled inclusion criteria. Nineteen studies evaluated KMC in LBW infants after stabilization, one evaluated KMC in LBW infants before stabilization, and one compared early-onset KMC with late-onset KMC in relatively stable LBW infants. Sixteen studies evaluated intermittent KMC, and five evaluated continuous KMC. KMC versus conventional neonatal care: At discharge or 40 to 41 weeks' postmenstrual age, KMC was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 to 0.92; eight trials, 1736 infants), nosocomial infection/sepsis (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.54; five trials, 1239 infants), and hypothermia (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.49; nine trials, 989 infants; moderate-quality evidence).

No statistically significant differences were found between KMC infants and controls in Griffith quotients for psychomotor development at 12 months' corrected age (low-quality evidence). Sensitivity analysis suggested that inclusion of studies with high risk of bias did not affect the general direction of findings nor the size of the treatment effect for main outcomes.

Concerns relating to the reported adverse effects of oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning led to a practice review and routine oro/nasopharyngeal suctioning is no longer recommended for vigorous infants. However, it is important to know whether there is any clear benefit or harm for infants whose oro/nasopharyngeal airway is suctioned compared to infants who are not suctioned. To evaluate the effect of routine oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal suction compared to no suction on mortality and morbidity in newly born infants.

Five studies included infants with no fetal distress and clear amniotic fluid, one large study included vigorous infants with clear or meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and two large studies included infants with thin or thick meconium-stained amniotic fluid.

No systematic assessment of mortality reduction from tactile stimulation or resuscitation has been published. To estimate the mortality effect of immediate newborn assessment and stimulation, and basic resuscitation on neonatal deaths due to term intrapartum-related events or preterm birth, for facility and home births. We conducted systematic reviews for studies reporting relevant mortality or morbidity outcomes. Evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria adapted to provide a systematic approach to mortality effect estimates for the Lives Saved Tool (LiST). Meta-analysis was performed if appropriate. For interventions with low quality evidence but strong recommendation for implementation, a Delphi panel was convened to estimate effect size. We identified 24 studies of neonatal resuscitation reporting mortality outcomes (20 observational, 2 quasi-experimental, 2 cluster randomized controlled trials), but none of immediate newborn assessment and stimulation alone. A meta-analysis of three facility-based studies examined the effect of resuscitation training on intrapartum-related neonatal deaths (RR= 0.70, 95%CI 0.59-0.84); this estimate was used for the effect of facility-based basic neonatal resuscitation (additional to stimulation). The evidence for preterm mortality effect was low quality and thus expert opinion was sought. In community-based studies, resuscitation training was part of packages with multiple concurrent interventions, and/or studies did not distinguish term intrapartum-related from preterm deaths, hence no meta-analysis was conducted. Our Delphi panel of 18 experts estimated that immediate newborn assessment and stimulation would reduce both intrapartum-related and preterm deaths by 10%, facility-based resuscitation would prevent a further 10% of preterm deaths, and community-based resuscitation would prevent further 20% of intrapartum-related and 5% of preterm deaths. Neonatal resuscitation training in facilities reduces term intrapartum-related deaths by 30%. Yet, coverage of this intervention remains low in countries where most neonatal deaths occur and is a missed opportunity to save lives. Expert opinion supports smaller effects of neonatal resuscitation on preterm mortality in facilities and of basic resuscitation and newborn assessment and stimulation at community level.

Until 1994, ELBWIs were intubated immediately after delivery when presenting the slightest signs of respiratory distress or asphyxia after initial resuscitation using a face mask and a handbag. During 1995, the guidelines for respiratory support were changed. In 1996, continuous (15 to 20 seconds), pressure controlled (20 to 25 cm H2O) inflation of the lungs using a nasal pharyngeal tube, followed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP; 4 to 6 cm H2O) was applied to all ELBWIs immediately after delivery to establish a functional residual capacity and perhaps to avoid EI/MV. In addition to the changes in respiratory support, the prevention of conductive and evaporative heat loss was improved in 1996. For analysis of morbidity and mortality, infants were matched for gestational age and birth weight. The rate of EI/MV in the DR decreased from 84% in 1994 to 40% in 1996. In 1996, 25% of the ELBWIs were never intubated (7% in 1994), but 35% of the ELBWIs needed secondary EI/MV, primarily because of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Initial ventilator settings, ventilator days, mortality, and morbidity were not different between ELBWIs with EI/MV in the DR and infants with secondary EI/MV attributable to RDS in the intensive care unit. ELBWIs with no EI/MV that was caused by RDS had a lower morbidity (ie, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage >grade 2 and/or periventricular leukomalacia), mortality, and fewer hospital days (mean: 79 vs 105 days). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects like feeding intolerance or necrotizing enterocolitis was not increased in 1996.

In our setting, the individualized intubation strategy in the DR restricted EI/MV to those ELBWIs who ultimately needed it, without increasing morbidity or mortality in infants with secondary EI/MV attributable to RDS.

One lamb in each pair was randomly selected to receive six manual inflations of 35-40 mL/kg (""bagging"") before the start of mechanical ventilation, a volume roughly corresponding to the inspiratory capacity of lamb lungs after prophylactic surfactant supplementation. Both siblings were given rescue porcine surfactant, 200 mg/kg, at 30 min of age. Blood gases and deflation pressure-volume (P-V) curves of the respiratory system were recorded until the lambs were killed at 4 h. The P-V curves became steeper after surfactant in the control group, but no such effect was seen in those subjected to bagging. At 4 h, inspiratory capacity and maximal deflation compliance were almost three times higher (p < 0.01) in the controls than in the bagged lambs. The latter were also more difficult to ventilate and tended to have less well expanded alveoli and more widespread lung injury in histologic sections.

Premature infants, who have severely reduced antioxidant defenses, are particularly sensitive to the toxic effects of oxygen. Supplemental oxygen in premature infants contributes to the development of chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), characterized by dysregulated inflammation and altered expression of proteases and growth factors. This can result in fibrosis, asymmetric aeration, and respiratory insufficiency. Oxygen also induces aberrant physiologic responses that can be damaging in premature infants. For example, vasoconstriction in the retina is an early response to oxygen that can lead to vasoobliteration, neovascularization, and retinal traction (retinopathy of prematurity). Increasing knowledge of the mechanisms underlying oxygen toxicity in premature infants has suggested strategies to minimize tissue injury and to optimize long-term medical outcomes.

Ten newborn lambs were chronically instrumented with catheters and flow transducers so that systemic, pulmonary arterial, left atrial and right atrial pressures as well as heart rate, cardiac output and left carotid artery flow could be monitored. During each of five asphyxia induced bradycardia episodes, with cardiac output depressed to approximately 30% of baseline, lambs were given either 0, 1, 10, 50, or 100 micrograms of EPI in a randomized sequence. After 30 s, the lambs were resuscitated with room air ventilation while hemodynamic parameters were monitored. During asphyxia and prior to EPI administration, all hemodynamic parameters were similar. In addition, for the first 30 s following EPI administration, hemodynamic parameters continued to deteriorate in a manner that was not influenced by the dose of EPI administered. During the resuscitation period with resumption of ventilation, systemic blood pressure and coronary perfusion pressure rose higher following 50 and 100 micrograms/kg of EPI than after the smaller doses. Heart rate was highest following the 100 micrograms/kg dose. Stroke volume and cardiac output, however, appeared to be blunted by the 100 micrograms/kg dose of EPI with no differences in carotid flow noted by dose of EPI administered. It appears that doses of EPI greater than 10 micrograms/kg, the dose currently recommended by the American Heart Association, may be beneficial as an adjunct in treatment of hemodynamically significant bradycardia. However, doses as high as 100 micrograms/kg may blunt cardiac output and stroke volume and should be used with caution.",success

For that reason, infusion of exogenous albumin as a volume expander has been proposed for various clinical settings including hypotension, delivery room resuscitation, sepsis and postoperative fluid management. Albumin is often prescribed in infants with hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and protein-losing conditions. However, the evidence of these practices has not been reviewed or validated. Albumin infusion may initiate highly complex processes that vary according to the individual and disease pathophysiology. Indeed, it may be associated with harms when misused.

We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group as outlined in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2007). Randomised controlled trials evaluating therapeutic hypothermia in term and late preterm newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy were identified by searching the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2007), previous reviews including cross-references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal handsearching.

We included randomised controlled trials comparing the use of therapeutic hypothermia with standard care in encephalopathic term or late preterm infants with evidence of peripartum asphyxia and without recognisable major congenital anomalies. The primary outcome measure was death or long-term major neurodevelopmental disability. Other outcomes included adverse effects of cooling and 'early' indicators of neurodevelopmental outcome. Four review authors independently selected, assessed the quality of and extracted data from the included studies. Study authors were contacted for further information.

The videotapes of all performances were later reviewed by two blinded independent assessors who rated participants' nontechnical skills using a validated scoring system. Participants' nontechnical skills did not improve in the control group, whereas the provision of oral feedback, either assisted or not assisted with videotape review, resulted in significant improvement (P < 0.005). There was no difference in improvement between oral and video-assisted oral feedback groups.

Despite this, in-hospital cardiac arrest has received little attention compared with other high-risk cardiovascular conditions, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In-hospital cardiac arrest occurs in over 290 000 adults each year in the United States. Cohort data from the United States indicate that the mean age of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest is 66 years, 58% are men, and the presenting rhythm is most often (81%) nonshockable (ie, asystole or pulseless electrical activity). The cause of the cardiac arrest is most often cardiac (50%-60%), followed by respiratory insufficiency (15%-40%). Efforts to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest require both a system for identifying deteriorating patients and an appropriate interventional response (eg, rapid response teams). The key elements of treatment during cardiac arrest include chest compressions, ventilation, early defibrillation, when applicable, and immediate attention to potentially reversible causes, such as hyperkalemia or hypoxia. There is limited evidence to support more advanced treatments. Post-cardiac arrest care is focused on identification and treatment of the underlying cause, hemodynamic and respiratory support, and potentially employing neuroprotective strategies (eg, targeted temperature management). Although multiple individual factors are associated with outcomes (eg, age, initial rhythm, duration of the cardiac arrest), a multifaceted approach considering both potential for neurological recovery and ongoing multiorgan failure is warranted for prognostication and clinical decision-making in the post-cardiac arrest period. Withdrawal of care in the absence of definite prognostic signs both during and after cardiac arrest should be avoided. Hospitals are encouraged to participate in national quality-improvement initiatives. An estimated 290 000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the United States.

There are 5 critical components of high-quality CPR: minimize interruptions in chest compressions, provide compressions of adequate rate and depth, avoid leaning between compressions, and avoid excessive ventilation. Although it is clear that high-quality CPR is the primary component in influencing survival from cardiac arrest, there is considerable variation in monitoring, implementation, and quality improvement. As such, CPR quality varies widely between systems and locations. Victims often do not receive high-quality CPR because of provider ambiguity in prioritization of resuscitative efforts during an arrest. This ambiguity also impedes the development of optimal systems of care to increase survival from cardiac arrest. This consensus statement addresses the following key areas of CPR quality for the trained rescuer: metrics of CPR performance; monitoring, feedback, and integration of the patient's response to CPR; team-level logistics to ensure performance of high-quality CPR; and continuous quality improvement on provider, team, and systems levels.

As a result, rates of bystander CPR and rates of survival from cardiac arrest are low. Bystander CPR is particularly uncommon in the African American community. Successful development of a simplified approach to CPR training could boost rates of bystander CPR and save lives. We conducted the following randomized, controlled study to determine whether video self-instruction (VSI) in CPR results in comparable or better performance than traditional CPR training. This randomized, controlled trial was conducted among congregational volunteers in an African American church in Atlanta, GA. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 34 minutes of VSI or the 4-hour American Heart Association ""Heartsaver"" CPR course. Two months after training, blinded observers used explicit criteria to assess CPR performance in a simulated cardiac arrest setting. A recording manikin was used to measure ventilation and chest compression characteristics. Participants also completed a written test of CPR-related knowledge and attitudes. VSI trainees displayed a comparable level of performance to that achieved by traditional trainees. Observers scored 40% of VSI trainees competent or better in performing CPR, compared with only 16% of traditional trainees (absolute difference 24%, 95% confidence interval 8% to 40%). Data from the recording manikin confirmed these observations. VSI trainees and traditional trainees achieved comparable scores on tests of CPR-related knowledge and attitudes. Thirty-four minutes of VSI can produce CPR of comparable quality to that achieved by traditional training methods. VSI provides a simple, quick, consistent, and inexpensive alternative to traditional CPR instruction, and may be used to extend CPR training to historically underserved populations.",success

To be able to implement the use of AEDs widely, many instructors are needed, and therefore, lay persons may also be used as trainers. The purpose of this randomized study was to compare lay volunteers trained by a lay person with those trained by a health care professional using the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Eight instructors, including four lay persons and four health care professionals, were given a basic course and an instructor course in CPR-D by the same instructor. All newly trained instructors trained 38 lay volunteers (19 pairs) who had no previous training in the use of a defibrillator. The lay volunteers performed the OSCE 2-3 weeks after the course. The OSCE comprised two scenarios with a manikin: the first, a patient in cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation, and the second, an imminent cardiac arrest with asystole as the initial rhythm. The same OSCE was performed by a group of lay first aiders practicing every 2 weeks who served as the control group. No statistical difference was present between the two groups of lay volunteers in the OSCE. All were able to use the AED and follow instructions. They identified patients with ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest, but had difficulties identifying cases with imminent cardiac arrest. The control group of trained first aiders performed significantly more effectively than the newly trained lay persons.

Pre- and post-intervention ""percent correct"" scores were compared and tested for statistical significance using paired t-tests or the McNemar test as appropriate. Improvement in knowledge and comfort levels were also compared across the different educational centers and compared with similar programs implemented in the United States.

Methods and Results An online survey was administered by YouGov to a nonprobabilistic purposive sample of UK adults, achieving 2084 participants, from a panel that was matched to be representative of the population. We used descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression modeling for analysis. Almost 52% were women, 61% were aged <55 years, and 19% had witnessed an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Proportions ever trained were 57% in chest-compression-only CPR, 59% in CPR , and 19.4% in PAD use. Most with training in any resuscitation technique had trained at work (54.7%). Compared with people not trained, those trained in PAD use said they were more likely to use one (odds ratio: 2.61), and those trained in CPR or chest-compression-only CPR were more likely to perform it (odds ratio: 5.39).

Subjects were randomised to receive either two additional refresher classes at intervals of 7 and 12 months or one additional refresher class after 12 months. Greater skill loss had occurred when the second refresher class was undertaken at 12 compared with 7 months. Skill retention however, was higher in the former group, ultimately resulting in no significant difference in final skill performance. There was no significant difference in performance between subjects attending two versus three refresher classes. On completion of refresher training all subjects were able to deliver countershocks, time to first shock decreased by 17s in both groups, and the proportion of subjects able to perform most skills increased. The execution of several important interventions remained poor, regardless of the total number of classes attended or the interval between them. These included CPR skills, defibrillation pad placement, and pre-shock safety checks. Refresher classes held more frequently and at shorter intervals increased subjects' self-assessed confidence, possibly indicating greater preparedness to use an AED in a real emergency. This study shows that the ability to deliver countershocks is maintained whether the second refresher class is held at seven or 12 months after the first. To limit skill deterioration between classes, however, refresher training intervals should not exceed 7 months. The quality of instruction given should be monitored carefully.

All subjects were tested immediately after their first instruction period and again at 6-9 months at an unheralded home visit. We were able to assess how far performance was related to poor acquisition of skills and how far it was related to skill decay. Out of 262 subjects who were randomised to receive conventional CPR instruction, 166 were available for home testing at 6-9 months. An invitation to attend for re-training had been accepted by 39 of them. The remaining 127 who attended only a single class comprise the principal study group, with additional comparative observations on the smaller re-trained cohort. Important failings were observed in the acquisition of skills in all modalities tested after the initial instruction. These were particularly marked in skills related to ventilation. Immediately after a class, 68% of trainees performed an effective check of breathing, but only 33% opened the airway as taught and no more than 18% provided an ideal ventilation volume. The technique of chest compression was also less than ideal. Although 80% of subjects placed their hands in an acceptable position, compression to an adequate depth and an adequate rate of compression were achieved by 54 and 63%, respectively. Seventy-eight percent demonstrated a careful approach, and 46% remembered to call for help. A carotid pulse check was simulated by 61% of trainees. When tested 6-9 months later, skill deterioration from this baseline was observed in all modalities tested except for the ventilation volume. The skill decay was significant (P<0.05) for the careful approach, performing an effective breathing check, the carotid pulse check, placing the hands in an acceptable position for chest compression, and compressing at an optimal rate. The minority who attended for re-training showed a trend to protection against skill decay for seven of the ten variables, compared with those who had attended only one training session. This improvement was significant for only two of them, but all were relatively small with limited practical value. Many who attend conventional CPR classes fail to acquire the necessary skills, and the skills that are acquired decline appreciably over the subsequent 6-9 months.

Self-assessment data were collected from all team members. Hospital records for pediatric CPA survival rates were examined for the study duration. Survival rates increased to approximately 50% (p = .000), correlating with the increased number of mock codes (r = .87). These results are significantly above the average national pediatric CPA survival rates and held steady for 3 consecutive years, demonstrating the stability of the program's outcomes. This study suggests that a simulation-based mock code program may significantly benefit pediatric patient CPA outcomes-applied clinical outcomes-not simply learner perceived value, increased confidence, or simulation-based outcomes.
