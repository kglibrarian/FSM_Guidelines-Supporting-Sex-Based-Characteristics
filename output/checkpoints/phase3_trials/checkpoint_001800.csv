Pediatrics and combined pediatrics/internal medicine interns were eligible for 6-month follow-up (n = 34). A randomized trial was conducted in which half of the participants in the team training arm practiced NRP skills by using high-fidelity simulators; the remaining practiced with low-fidelity simulators, as did control subjects. Blinded, trained observers viewed video recordings of high-fidelity-simulated resuscitations for teamwork and resuscitation quality. High-fidelity training (HFT) group had higher teamwork frequency than did control subjects (12.8 vs 9.0 behaviors per minute; P < .001). Intervention groups maintained more workload management (control subjects: 89.3%; low-fidelity training [LFT] group: 98.0% [P < .001]; HFT group: 98.8%; HFT group versus control subjects [P < .001]) and completed resuscitations faster (control subjects: 10.6 minutes; LFT group: 8.6 minutes [P = .040]; HFT group: 7.4 minutes; HFT group versus control subjects [P < .001]). Overall, intervention teams completed the resuscitation an average of 2.6 minutes faster than did control subjects, a time reduction of 24% (95% confidence interval: 12%-37%). Intervention groups demonstrated more frequent teamwork during 6-month follow-up resuscitations (11.8 vs 10.0 behaviors per minute; P = .030). Trained participants exhibited more frequent teamwork behaviors (especially the HFT group) and better workload management and completed the resuscitation more quickly than did control subjects. The impact on team behaviors persisted for at least 6 months. Incorporating team training into the NRP curriculum is a feasible and effective way to teach interns teamwork skills.

During a baseline visit, the medical students participated in a video-taped simulated witnessed cardiac arrest. Participants were thereafter randomized to receive instructions focusing either on correct positions of arms and shoulders (technical instruction group) or on leadership and communication to enhance team coordination (leadership instruction group). A follow-up simulation was conducted after 4 mos. The primary outcome was the amount of hands-on time, defined as duration of uninterrupted cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the first 180 secs after the onset of the cardiac arrest (hands-on time) [corrected]. Secondary outcomes were time to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation, total leadership utterances, and technical skills. Outcomes were compared based on videotapes coded by two independent researchers. After a balanced performance at baseline, the leadership instruction group demonstrated a longer hands-on time (120 secs; interquartile range, 98-135 vs. 87 secs; interquartile range, 61-108; p < .001), a shorter median time to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (44 secs; interquartile range, 32-62; vs. 67 secs; interquartile range, 43-79; p = .018), and had more leadership utterances (7; interquartile range, 4-10; vs. 5; interquartile range, 2-8; p = .02) in the follow-up visit.

The aims of this study were to investigate whether real time objective feedback on manikins helps improve CPR performance and whether competition between separate European Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and between participants at each EMS helps motivation to train. Ten European EMS took part in the study and was carried out in two stages. At Stage 1, each EMS provided 20 pre-hospital professionals. A questionnaire was completed and standardised assessment scenarios were performed for adult and infant out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). CPR performance was objectively measured and recorded but no feedback given. Between Stage 1 and 2, each EMS was given access to manikins for 6 months and instructed on how to use with objective real-time CPR feedback available. Stage 2 was undertaken and was a repeat of Stage 1 with a questionnaire with additional questions relating to usefulness of feedback and the competition nature of the study (using a 10 point Likert score). The EMS that improved the most from Stage 1 to Stage 2 was declared the winner.

The teams were tested across two different ACLS procedures that vary in the degree of task complexity: ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (VFib/VTach) and pulseless electric activity (PEA). The difference in performance between control and persuasive groups was not statistically significant (P=.37 for PEA and P=.1 for VFib/VTach). However, the difference in performance between control and minimally persuasive groups was significant (P=.05 for PEA and P=.02 for VFib/VTach). The pre-post comparison of performances of the groups showed that control (P=.017 for PEA, P=.01 for VFib/VTach) and persuasive (P=.02 for PEA, P=.048 for VFib/VTach) groups improved their performances significantly, whereas minimally persuasive group did not (P=.45 for PEA, P=.46 for VFib/VTach). Results also suggest that the benefit of persuasiveness is constrained by the potentially interruptive nature of these features. Our results indicate that the VR-based ACLS training with proper feedback components can provide a learning experience similar to face-to-face training, and therefore could serve as a more easily accessed supplementary training tool to the traditional ACLS training. Our findings also suggest that the degree of persuasive features in VR environments have to be designed considering the interruptive nature of the feedback elements.",success

Elements were classified as core or supplemental using a modified Delphi process primarily based on respondents' assessment of the evidence-based importance of capturing those elements, tempered by the challenges to collect them. New or modified elements reflected consensus on the need to account for emergency medical services system factors, increasing availability of automated external defibrillators, data collection processes, epidemiology trends, increasing use of dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emerging field treatments, postresuscitation care, prognostication tools, and trends in organ recovery. A standard reporting template is recommended to promote standardized reporting. This template facilitates reporting of the bystander-witnessed, shockable rhythm as a measure of emergency medical services system efficacy and all emergency medical services system-treated arrests as a measure of system effectiveness. Several additional important subgroups are identified that enable an estimate of the specific contribution of rhythm and bystander actions that are key determinants of outcome.",success

To analyze the impact of physician's inexperience in EMS (<1 year in EMS) on resuscitation management, we assessed physician's turnover in EMSVz, as well as OHCA survival, airway management, and adherence to resuscitation guidelines in regard to physician's EMS experience. Of 276 patients (median age 68 years, interquartile range [IQR] 16; 198 male; 37% ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia, bystander CPR rate 25%), 80 were transferred to hospital and 39 were discharged (median survival after discharge 23 months, IQR 46 months). During the 7-year study period, 29 newly graduated physicians inexperienced in EMS started to work in EMSVz (performing 77 resuscitations), while 48% of them stayed for less than one year. Airway management depended on physician's EMS experience (P=0.018): inexperienced physicians performed bag-valve-mask ventilation (BMV) more than the experienced, with no impact on survival rate. Physician's EMS experience did not influence adherence to resuscitation guidelines (P=0.668), survival to hospital discharge (P=0.791), or survival time (P=0.405).

From 1980 through 1984, resuscitation attempts were conducted only in the ICU. By 1985, after the training program was instituted, resuscitation efforts were conducted throughout the hospital. Data are presented on resuscitations in the ICU only and on total hospital resuscitations. To assess effort, resuscitation attempts and successes were compared with total death events (ie, total number of hospital deaths plus total number surviving a resuscitation effort). From 1980 through 1984, before ACLS training was instituted, 42 patients were resuscitated and 15 (36%) survived to discharge.

The authors performed a prospective, observational study (January 1997 to May 2003) of individuals who called 911 (bystanders) at the time of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. A structured telephone interview of adult cardiac-arrest bystanders was performed beginning two weeks after the incident. Elements gathered during interviews included bystander and patient demographics, identifying whether the bystander was CPR trained, when and by whom the CPR was performed, and describing the circumstances of the event. If CPR was not performed, we asked the bystanders why CPR was not performed. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for factors associated with CPR performance. Of 868 cardiac arrests, 684 (78.1%) bystander interviews were completed. Of all bystanders interviewed, 69.6% were family members of the victims, 36.8% of the bystanders had more than a high-school education, and 54.1% had been taught CPR at some time. In 21.2% of patients, the bystander immediately started CPR, and in 33.6% of cases, someone started CPR before the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS). Important overall predictors of CPR performance were the following: witnessed arrest (OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.4 to 3.8); bystander was CPR trained (OR = 6.6; 95% CI = 3.5 to 12.5); bystander had more than a high-school education (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.1), or arrest occurred in a public location (OR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.7 to 5.8). These variables were significant predictors of CPR performance among CPR-trained bystanders, as was CPR training within five years (OR = 4.5; 95% CI = 2.8 to 7.3). Common reasons that the CPR-trained bystanders cited for not performing CPR were the following: 37.5% stated that they panicked, 9.1% perceived that they would not be able to do CPR correctly, and 1.1% thought that they would hurt the patient. Surprisingly, only 1.1% objected to performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. A minority of CPR-trained bystanders performed CPR. CPR provision was more common in CPR-trained bystanders with more than a high-school education and when CPR training had been within five years. Previously espoused reasons for not doing CPR (mouth-to-mouth, infectious-disease risk) were not the reasons that bystanders cited for not doing CPR.

Accurate prognostication is important to avoid pursuing futile treatments when poor outcome is inevitable but also to avoid an inappropriate withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients who may otherwise have a chance of achieving meaningful neurological recovery. Inaccurate neurological prognostication leading to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and deaths may significantly bias clinical studies, leading to failure in detecting the true study outcomes.

We generated a 5-kilometer radius surrounding each training site to estimate any geospatial influence that training sites might have on bystander CPR frequency in nearby OHCA cases. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and t-tests assessed differences in subject features. Difference-in-differences analysis with generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling assessed bystander CPR frequency, adjusting for training site, covariates (age, sex, witnessed, shockable rhythm, public location), and clustering around training sites. Similar modeling tested for changes in bystander CPR type, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital discharge, and cerebral performance category (CPC) of 1-2 at hospital discharge. We included 899 cases before and 587 cases post-intervention. Overall, we observed no increase in the frequency of bystander CPR or favorable clinical outcomes.

Of the reported 6675 cases, 24% suffered ventricular fibrillation (VF), 162 patients (15%) of all VF cases were defibrillated before EMS arrival, 46% with a public AED on site. The proportion of cases defibrillated before EMS arrival increased from 5% in 2008 to 20% in 2015 (p<0.001). During this period, 30-day survival increased in patients with VF from 22% to 28% (p=0.04) and was highest when an AED was used on site (68%), with a median delay of 6.5min from collapse to defibrillation. Adjusted odds ratio for on-site defibrillation versus dispatched defibrillation for 30-day survival was 2.45 (95% CI: 1.02-5.95). The use of AEDs before the arrival of EMS increased over time.

An electronic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane DSR, DARE, ACP Journal Club, and CCTR was conducted (January 1, 1950 to August 21, 2008) for studies reporting OHCA of presumed cardiac etiology in adults. Data were extracted from 79 studies involving 142 740 patients. The pooled survival rate to hospital admission was 23.8% (95% CI, 21.1 to 26.6) and to hospital discharge was 7.6% (95% CI, 6.7 to 8.4). Stratified by baseline rates, survival to hospital discharge was more likely among those: witnessed by a bystander (6.4% to 13.5%), witnessed by EMS (4.9% to 18.2%), who received bystander CPR (3.9% to 16.1%), were found in ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (14.8% to 23.0%), or achieved return of spontaneous circulation (15.5% to 33.6%). Although 53% (95% CI, 45.0% to 59.9%) of events were witnessed by a bystander, only 32% (95% CI, 26.7% to 37.8%) received bystander CPR. The number needed to treat to save 1 life ranged from 16 to 23 for EMS-witnessed arrests, 17 to 71 for bystander-witnessed, and 24 to 36 for those receiving bystander CPR, depending on baseline survival rates. The aggregate survival rate of OHCA (7.6%) has not significantly changed in almost 3 decades. Overall survival from OHCA has been stable for almost 30 years, as have the strong associations between key predictors and survival.

From a cardiac arrest surveillance system in place since 1976 in King County, Washington, we selected 1,667 cardiac arrest patients with a high likelihood of survival: they had underlying heart disease, were in ventricular fibrillation, and had arrested before arrival of emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. For each patient, we obtained the time intervals from collapse to CPR, to first defibrillatory shock, and to initiation of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). A multiple linear regression model fitting the data gave the following equation: survival rate = 67%-2.3% per minute to CPR-1.1% per minute to defibrillation-2.1% per minute to ACLS, which was significant at P < .001. The first term, 67%, represents the survival rate if all three interventions were to occur immediately on collapse. Without treatment (CPR, defibrillatory shock, or definitive care), the decline in survival rate is the sum of the three coefficients, or 5.5% per minute. Survival rates predicted by the model for given EMS response times approximated published observed rates for EMS systems in which paramedics respond with or without emergency medical technicians. The model is useful in planning community EMS programs, comparing EMS systems, and showing how different arrival times within a system affect survival rate.",success

It is a major challenge for the emergency medical system as decreased survival rates are directly proportional to the time delay from collapse to defibrillation. Historically, defibrillation has only been performed by physicians and in-hospital. With the development of automated external defibrillators (AEDs), rapid defibrillation by nonmedical professionals and subsequently by trained or untrained lay bystanders has become possible. Much hope has been put to the concept of Public Access Defibrillation with a massive dissemination of public available AEDs throughout most Western countries. Accordingly, current guidelines recommend that AEDs should be deployed in places with a high likelihood of OHCA. Despite these efforts, AED use is in most settings anecdotal with little effect on overall OHCA survival. The major reasons for low use of public AEDs are that most OHCAs take place outside high incidence sites of cardiac arrest and that most OHCAs take place in residential settings, currently defined as not suitable for Public Access Defibrillation. However, the use of new technology for identification and recruitment of lay bystanders and nearby AEDs to the scene of the cardiac arrest as well as new methods for strategic AED placement redefines and challenges the current concept and definitions of Public Access Defibrillation. Existing evidence of Public Access Defibrillation and knowledge gaps and future directions to improve outcomes for OHCA are discussed.

Sudden cardiac arrest is the unexpected loss of heart function, breathing, and consciousness and is commonly the result of an electric disturbance in the heart. Unfortunately, only ≈1 in 10 victims survives this dramatic event. Early access to 9-1-1 and early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are the first 2 links in the chain of survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Although 9-1-1 is frequently accessed, in the majority of cases, individuals with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest do not receive lay rescuer CPR and wait for the arrival of professional emergency rescuers. Telecommunicators are the true first responders and a critical link in the cardiac arrest chain of survival. In partnership with the 9-1-1 caller, telecommunicators have the first opportunity to identify a patient in cardiac arrest and provide initial care by delivering CPR instructions while quickly dispatching emergency medical services. The telecommunicator and the caller form a unique team in which the expertise of the telecommunicator is provided just in time to a willing caller, transforming the caller into a lay rescuer delivering CPR.

We divided the study population into groups with and without descriptors for abnormal breathing to investigate the impact of these descriptors on patient outcomes and telephone CPR process. Callers used descriptors in 459 of 2411 cases (19.0%) between October 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. Survival outcome was better when the caller used a breathing descriptor (19.6% versus 8.8%, <i>P</i><0.0001), with an odds ratio of 1.63 (95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.25). After exclusions, 379 of 459 cases were eligible for process analysis. When callers described abnormal breathing, the rates of telecommunicator OHCA recognition, CPR instruction, and telephone CPR were lower than when callers did not use a breathing descriptor (79.7% versus 93.0%, <i>P</i><0.0001; 65.4% versus 72.5%, <i>P</i>=0.0078; and 60.2% versus 66.9%, <i>P</i>=0.0123, respectively). The time interval between call receipt and OHCA recognition was longer when the caller used a breathing descriptor (118.5 versus 73.5 seconds, <i>P</i><0.0001). Descriptors of abnormal breathing are associated with improved outcomes but also with delays in the identification of OHCA. Familiarizing telecommunicators with these descriptors may improve the telephone CPR process including OHCA recognition for patients with increased probability of survival.",success

We have set up a dispatcher-assisted CPR protocol at our call centre, based on international guidelines issued in 2010. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of this protocol on CA diagnosis and quantity of recommendations given by telephone dispatchers to untrained witnesses. We performed a 'before and after' monocentric observational study. Data were compared before and a short time after (2 months) implementation of the protocol. We included patients presenting as an out-of-hospital CA in the presence of a witness untrained in CPR. Fisher's test was used to compare periods. P < 0.05 was considered significant. During the 8 month period before the protocol, 115 victims were potentially eligible for CPR. Diagnosis was achieved in 63.5% of cases and CPR recommendations given in 6.1%. After implementation of the protocol, 130 victims were potentially eligible for CPR. Frequency of CA diagnosis was significantly higher after the protocol with 76% of cases (P = 0.0359). Frequency of CPR recommendations given to witnesses was also significantly higher after the protocol, with a fivefold increase up to 29.2% (P < 0.0001). Implementation of a dispatcher-assisted CPR protocol was efficient in improving both CA diagnosis and CPR recommendations given to untrained witnesses for out-of-hospital CA with a very short time of dispatcher training.

After giving written informed consent, 83 medically untrained laypersons were randomised to perform basic life support for 300s with or without a supportive flowchart. The primary outcome parameter was hands-off time (HOT). Furthermore, the participants' confidence in their actions on a 10-point Likert-like scale and time-to-chest compressions were assessed.

We prospectively collected data on clinical processes and outcomes from 3733 consecutively enrolled patients 16 years of age or older who were undergoing noncardiac surgery. We subsequently collected data on 3955 consecutively enrolled patients after the introduction of the Surgical Safety Checklist. The primary end point was the rate of complications, including death, during hospitalization within the first 30 days after the operation. The rate of death was 1.5% before the checklist was introduced and declined to 0.8% afterward (P=0.003). Inpatient complications occurred in 11.0% of patients at baseline and in 7.0% after introduction of the checklist (P<0.001). Implementation of the checklist was associated with concomitant reductions in the rates of death and complications among patients at least 16 years of age who were undergoing noncardiac surgery in a diverse group of hospitals.",success

We studied 100 patients transplanted with kidneys between 1989 and 2004, using NHBD, supported by heart compression and mechanical ventilation (n = 24), intravascular in situ cooling (n = 59), or cardiorespiratory resuscitation plus manual abdominal counterpulsation without cooling (n = 17), the last technique being used from 1998. The median follow-up was 51 +/- 51 months (range, 1 to 170). The outcomes of these procedures were compared to those of 1025 transplantations of kidneys from HBD performed during the same period. The characteristics of the recipients did not differ significantly between the two groups. Kidneys from NHBD showed a significantly higher rate of delayed graft function (DGF; 84% vs 26%; (P < .001), furthermore, the primary nonfunction (PNF) incidence was significantly higher with NHBD vs HBD (16% vs 10%; P < .001). The incidence of acute rejection episodes (ARE) within 3 months and at 1 year did not differ between the groups of donors; however, more NHBD kidneys were lost from ARE. The short-term (3-month and 1 year) and long-term (5 and 10 years) renal function, determined by the serum creatinine levels, and patient and graft survival were not different for kidneys obtained from NHBD. The incidences of PNF and DGF were significantly higher with NHBD, which produced poorer renal function at the time of hospital discharge. One-, 5-, and 10-year graft survivals and renal function did not differ between NHBD and HBD grafts. In our series, PNF was the main barrier to the use of NHBD.",success

If the patient, facing the end of life, wishes to donate organs after cardiac arrest (CA), donation after cardiac death (DCD) is increasingly important for the realization of the patient's desires after CA. In Japan, kidney transplantation from uncontrolled DCD donors, who are identified in modified Maastricht categories II or V, is one of the critical factors in expanding the donor pool. However, according to the forensic code for post-mortems and the requirement of legal consent for transplantation, the time required to meet all procedural requirements has sometimes prohibited organ procurement from uncontrolled DCD donors. We have therefore attempted to use an automated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) device and maintain arterial pressure for uncontrolled DCD donors during all interim procedures after sudden CA. Comparing kidneys procured from standard DCD donors (n = 10) and uncontrolled DCD donors (n = 4), significant differences were seen in warm ischemic time (WIT), defined as the time from CA to initiation of cooling in situ. However, our early experience showed good tolerance and viability of uncontrolled DCD kidneys.

In parallel, some countries have developed uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD) programs using ECMO to preserve organs for transplantation purposes. When facing a refractory OHCA, how does the medical team choose between initiating ECMO as part of an E-CPR protocol or ECMO as part of a uDCDD protocol? To answer these questions we conducted a literature review on E-CPR compared to uDCDD protocols using ECMO and analyzed the raised ethical issues. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion criteria in E-CPR and uDCDD protocols are similar. There may be a non-negligible risk of including patients in a uDCDD protocol, when the patient might have been saved by the use of E-CPR. In order to avoid the fatal error of letting a saveable patient die, safeguards are necessary. We recommend: (1) the development of internationally accepted termination of resuscitation guidelines that would have to be satisfied prior to inclusion of patients in any uDCDD protocol, (2) the choice regarding modalities of ongoing resuscitation during transfer should be focused on the primary priority of attempting to save the life of patients, (3) only centers of excellence in life-saving resuscitation should initiate or maintain uDCDD programs, (4) E-CPR should be clinically considered first before the initiation of any uDCDD protocol, and (5) there should be no discrimination in the availability of access to E-CPR.",success

We systematically searched databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus, and reviewed previous bibliographies for original comparative studies investigating the use of TES with debriefing in training health care providers.

From 10 903 potentially eligible studies, we identified 177 studies (11 511 learners) that employed debriefing as part of TES. Key characteristics of debriefing (e.g. duration, educator presence and characteristics, content, structure/method, timing, use of video) were usually incompletely reported. A meta-analysis of four studies demonstrated that video-assisted debriefing has negligible and non-significant effects for time skills (ES = 0.10) compared with non-video-assisted debriefing. Meta-analysis demonstrated non-significant effects in favour of expert modelling with short debriefing in comparison with long debriefing (ES range = 0.21-0.74). Among studies comparing terminal with concurrent debriefing, results were variable depending on outcome measures and the context of training (e.g. medical resuscitation versus technical skills). Eight additional studies revealed insight into the roles of other debriefing-related factors (e.g. multimedia debriefing, learner-led debriefing, debriefing duration, content of debriefing). Among studies that compared simulation plus debriefing with no intervention, pooled ESs were favourable for all outcomes (ES range = 0.28-2.16). Limited evidence suggests that video-assisted debriefing yields outcomes similar to those of non-video-assisted debriefing. Other debriefing design features show mixed or non-significant results.

Post-implementation, INFO critical event debriefings have become part of our ED culture, take place regularly in our EDs (254 documented debriefings between March 2016 and September 2017), with recommendations arising from these debriefings being introduced into clinical practice. The INFO clinical debriefing process addresses two significant barriers to regular ED clinical debriefing: a lack of trained facilitators and the focus on physician-led debriefings. Our experience shows that a nurse-facilitated debriefing is feasible, can be successfully implemented in diverse EDs, and can be performed by relatively inexperienced debriefers.

In the past, changes in one's approach to resuscitation had to await the semi-decennial publications of guidelines. Following approved guidelines (at times based on consensus), survival rates of patients with OHCA were extremely variable, with only a few areas having good results. An alternative approach to improving survival is to use continuous quality improvement (CQI), a process often used to address public health problems. Continuous quality improvement advocates that one obtain baseline data and, if not optimal, make changes and continuously re-evaluate the results. Using CQI, we instituted cardiocerebral resuscitation as an alternative approach and found significant improvement in survival of patients with OHCA. The changes we made to the therapy of patients with primary OHCA, called cardiocerebral resuscitation, were based primarily on extensive experimental laboratory data.

Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3·9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1-4·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7·2% (6·0-8·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9% (6·6-9·2) for males and 6·5% (5·4-7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95% UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs s1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss.

We estimated that there were 319,400 (95% uncertainty interval, 297,300 to 337,300) deaths due to rheumatic heart disease in 2015. Global age-standardized mortality due to rheumatic heart disease decreased by 47.8% (95% uncertainty interval, 44.7 to 50.9) from 1990 to 2015, but large differences were observed across regions. In 2015, the highest age-standardized mortality due to and prevalence of rheumatic heart disease were observed in Oceania, South Asia, and central sub-Saharan Africa. We estimated that in 2015 there were 33.4 million (95% uncertainty interval, 29.7 million to 43.1 million) cases of rheumatic heart disease and 10.5 million (95% uncertainty interval, 9.6 million to 11.5 million) disability-adjusted life-years due to rheumatic heart disease globally. We estimated the global disease prevalence of and mortality due to rheumatic heart disease over a 25-year period. The health-related burden of rheumatic heart disease has declined worldwide, but high rates of disease persist in some of the poorest regions in the world.

We searched Medline, Embase, the Latin American and Caribbean System on Health Sciences Information, African Journals Online, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for population-based studies published between Jan 1, 1993, and June 30, 2014, that reported on prevalence of rheumatic heart disease among children and adolescents (≥ 5 years to <18 years). We assessed prevalence of clinically silent and clinically manifest rheumatic heart disease in random effects meta-analyses according to screening modality and geographical region. We assessed the association between social inequality and rheumatic heart disease with the Gini coefficient. We used Poisson regression to analyse the effect of age on prevalence of rheumatic heart disease and estimated the incidence of rheumatic heart disease from prevalence data. We included 37 populations in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of rheumatic heart disease detected by cardiac auscultation was 2·9 per 1000 people (95% CI 1·7-5·0) and by echocardiography it was 12·9 per 1000 people (8·9-18·6), with substantial heterogeneity between individual reports for both screening modalities (I² = 99·0% and 94·9%, respectively). We noted an association between social inequality expressed by the Gini coefficient and prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (p = 0·0002). The prevalence of clinically silent rheumatic heart disease (21·1 per 1000 people, 95% CI 14·1-31·4) was about seven to eight times higher than that of clinically manifest disease (2·7 per 1000 people, 1·6-4·4).

With cardiovascular disease being the largest contributor to global mortality, accounting for nearly half of the 36 million annual noncommunicable disease deaths, achieving the 2025 goal requires that cardiovascular disease and its risk factors be aggressively addressed. The Global Cardiovascular Disease Taskforce, comprising the World Heart Federation, American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Heart Network, and European Society of Cardiology, with expanded representation from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, along with global cardiovascular disease experts, disseminates information and approaches to reach the United Nations 2025 targets. The writing committee, which reflects Global Cardiovascular Disease Taskforce membership, engaged the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, to develop region-specific estimates of premature cardiovascular mortality in 2025 based on various scenarios. Results show that >5 million premature CVD deaths among men and 2.8 million among women are projected worldwide by 2025, which can be reduced to 3.5 million and 2.2 million, respectively, if risk factor targets for blood pressure, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, and obesity are achieved. However, global risk factor targets have various effects, depending on region. For most regions, United Nations targets for reducing systolic blood pressure and tobacco use have more substantial effects on future scenarios compared with maintaining current levels of body mass index and fasting plasma glucose. However, preventing increases in body mass index has the largest effect in some high-income countries.

Affected individuals are young and associated morbidity is high. However, RHD is relatively neglected due to the populations involved and its lower incidence relative to other heart diseases. In this narrative review, we describe how RHD care can be informed by and integrated with models of care developed for priority non-communicable diseases (coronary heart disease), and high-burden communicable diseases (tuberculosis). Examining the four-level prevention model (primordial through tertiary prevention) suggests primordial and primary prevention of RHD can leverage off existing tuberculosis control efforts, given shared risk factors. Successes in coronary heart disease control provide inspiration for similarly bold initiatives for RHD. Further, we illustrate how the Chronic Care Model (CCM), developed for use in non-communicable diseases, offers a relevant framework to approach RHD care. Systems strengthening through greater integration of services can improve RHD programs. Strengthening of systems through integration/linkages with other well-performing and resourced services in conjunction with policies to adopt the CCM framework for the secondary and tertiary prevention of RHD in settings with limited resources, has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of RHD globally.

Long-term antibiotic secondary prophylaxis is used to prevent disease progression, but evidence for benefits of different adherence levels is limited. Using data from northern Australia, we identified factors associated with adherence, and the association between adherence and ARF recurrence, progression to rheumatic heart disease, worsening or improvement of rheumatic heart disease, and mortality. Methods and Results Factors associated with adherence (percent of doses administered) were analyzed using logistic regression. Nested case-control and case-crossover designs were used to investigate associations with clinical outcomes; conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios ( OR ) with 95% CIs Adherence estimates (7728) were analyzed. Being female, younger, having more-severe disease, and living remotely were associated with higher adherence. Alcohol misuse was associated with lower adherence. The risk of ARF recurrence did not decrease until ≈40% of doses had been administered. Receiving <80% was associated with a 4-fold increase in the odds of ARF recurrence (case-control OR : 4.00 [95% CI : 1.7-9.29], case-crossover OR : 3.31 [95% CI : 1.09-10.07]) and appeared to be associated with increased all-cause mortality (case-control OR : 1.90 [95% CI : 0.89-4.06]; case-crossover OR 1.91 [95% CI : 0.51-7.12]).

Country-level data about BPG shortages were collected using 3 survey approaches. First, a survey designed by the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research was distributed to 41 countries and territories in the Americas and 41 more in Africa. Second, WHO conducted an email survey of 28 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention country directors. An additional 13 countries were in contact with WHO for related congenital syphilis prevention activities and also reported on BPG shortages. Third, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) collected data from 14 countries (where it has active operations) to understand the extent of stock-outs, in-country purchasing, usage behavior, and breadth of available purchasing options to identify stock-outs worldwide. CHAI also conducted in-person interviews in the same 14 countries to understand the extent of stock-outs, in-country purchasing and usage behavior, and available purchasing options. CHAI also completed a desk review of 10 additional high-income countries, which were also included. BPG shortages were attributable to shortfalls in supply, demand, and procurement in the countries assessed. This assessment should not be considered globally representative as countries not surveyed may also have experienced BPG shortages. Country contacts may not have been aware of BPG shortages when surveyed or may have underreported medication substitutions due to desirability bias. Funding for the purchase of BPG by countries was not evaluated. In all, 114 countries and territories were approached to provide information on BPG shortages occurring during 2014-2016.

In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex. We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95% UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1%) of 46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9% since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8%). This was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28%. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted. Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",success

Detailed epidemiologic studies of impetigo, particularly among indigenous communities in the Pacific among whom rheumatic fever is endemic, find the disease remarkably prevalent. In contrast, group A streptococcal pharyngitis occurs no more frequently than in regions wherein rheumatic fever is now rare.

Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the methodology outlined in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration were used. No new studies were included in this update. Eight randomised controlled trials involving 996 people were selected for inclusion in the review. Researchers compared several steroidal agents such as corticotrophin, cortisone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin versus aspirin, placebo or no treatment. Six trials were conducted between 1950 and 1965; one was done in 1990 and the final study was published in 2001.

However, all results should be interpreted with caution because of the age of the studies and the substantial risk of bias. Little evidence of benefit was found when corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulins were used to reduce the risk of heart valve lesions in patients with acute rheumatic fever. The antiquity of most of the trials restricted adequate statistical analysis of the data and acceptable assessment of clinical outcomes by current standards. In addition, risk of bias was substantial, so results should be viewed with caution.

Telemedicine, using cloud-server technology, provides an ideal solution for sharing images performed by non-physicians with cardiologists who are experts in rheumatic heart disease. Objective We describe our experience in using telemedicine to support a large rheumatic heart disease outreach screening programme in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Methods The Programa de Rastreamento da Valvopatia Reumática (PROVAR) is a prospective cross-sectional study aimed at gathering epidemiological data on the burden of rheumatic heart disease in Minas Gerais and testing of a non-expert, telemedicine-supported model of outreach rheumatic heart disease screening. The primary goal is to enable expert support of remote rheumatic heart disease outreach through cloud-based sharing of echocardiographic images between Minas Gerais and Washington. Secondary goals include (a) developing and sharing online training modules for non-physicians in echocardiography performance and interpretation and (b) utilising a secure web-based system to share clinical and research data. Results PROVAR included 4615 studies that were performed by non-experts at 21 schools and shared via cloud-telemedicine technology. Latent rheumatic heart disease was found in 251 subjects (4.2% of subjects: 3.7% borderline and 0.5% definite disease). Of the studies, 50% were preformed on full functional echocardiography machines and transmitted via Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and 50% were performed on handheld echocardiography machines and transferred via a secure Dropbox connection. The average time between study performance date and interpretation was 10 days. There was 100% success in initial image transfer. Less than 1% of studies performed by non-experts could not be interpreted. Discussion A sustainable, low-cost telehealth model, using task-shifting with non-medical personal in low and middle income countries can improve access to echocardiography for rheumatic heart disease.",success

In total, 103 consecutive RHD patients were recruited as cases who reported to the National Centre for Control of Rheumatic Fever and Heart Disease, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Of 309 controls, 103 were RF patients selected from the same centre, and the remaining 206 controls were selected from Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, who got admitted for other non-cardiac ailments. RHD was confirmed by auscultation and colour Doppler echocardiography. RF was diagnosed based on the modified Jones criteria. An unadjusted odds ratio was generated for each variable, with 95% confidence interval (CI), and only significant factors were considered candidate for multivariate analysis. Three separate binary logistic regression models were generated to assess the risk factors of RF, risk factors of RHD compared to non-rheumatic control patients, and risk factors of RHD compared to control with RF. RF and RHD shared almost a similar set of risk factors in the population. In general, age over 19 years was found to be protective of RF; however, age of the majority (62.1%) of the RHD cases was over 19 years.

Twenty-four studies were selected for comparison based on their uniform methodological and diagnostic techniques. There is a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in the Pacific region with a lower prevalence in the Indian subcontinent, Asian, sub-Saharan African, Mediterranean, Latin American and Caribbean regions. However, aside from the Indian subcontinent, these regions have not been well studied, and it may be that the true prevalence is actually higher. There is a lack of good quality prevalence surveys of rheumatic heart disease in developing countries. It appears that a threshold level where higher socio-economic status is associated with reduced prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is not reached in developing countries. Therefore, differences in prevalence between socio-economic groups in the one area cannot be detected. A similar case can be made for overcrowding.

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Although sexual minorities have high rates of several modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (including stress, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption), there is a paucity of research in this area. In this systematic review, we synthesized and critiqued the existing evidence on cardiovascular disease among sexual minority adults. We conducted a thorough literature search of 6 electronic databases for studies published between January 1985 and December 2015 that compared cardiovascular disease risk or prevalence between sexual minority and heterosexual adults. We included peer-reviewed English-language studies that compared cardiovascular disease risk or diagnoses between sexual minority and heterosexual individuals older than 18 years. We excluded reviews, case studies, and gray literature. A total of 31 studies met inclusion criteria. At least 2 authors independently abstracted data from each study. We performed quality assessment of retrieved studies using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. Sexual minority women exhibited greater cardiovascular disease risk related to tobacco use, alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, poor mental health, and body mass index, whereas sexual minority men experienced excess risk related to tobacco use, illicit drug use, and poor mental health. We identified several limitations in the extant literature. The majority of included studies were cross-sectional analyses that used self-reported measures of cardiovascular disease. Even though we observed elevated cardiovascular disease risk, we found few differences in cardiovascular disease diagnoses (including hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol). Overall, 23 of the 26 studies that examined cardiovascular disease diagnoses used subjective measures.

Despite gains in rights and media attention, the reality is that transgender persons experience health disparities, and a dearth of research and evidence-based guidelines remains regarding their specific health needs. The lack of research to characterize cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors in transgender populations receiving cross-sex hormone therapy (CSHT) limits appropriate primary and specialty care. As with hormone therapy in cisgender persons (that is, those whose sex assigned at birth aligns with their gender identity), existing research in transgender populations suggests that CVD risk factors are altered by CSHT. Currently, systemic hormone replacement for cisgender adults requires a nuanced discussion based on baseline risk factors and age of administration of exogenous hormones because of concern regarding an increased risk for myocardial infarction and stroke. For transgender adults, CSHT has been associated with the potential for worsening CVD risk factors (such as blood pressure elevation, insulin resistance, and lipid derangements), although these changes have not been associated with increases in morbidity or mortality in transgender men receiving CSHT. For transgender women, CSHT has known thromboembolic risk, and lower-dose transdermal estrogen formulations are preferred over high-dose oral formulations. In addition, many studies of transgender adults focus predominantly on younger persons, limiting the generalizability of CSHT in older transgender adults. The lack of randomized controlled trials comparing various routes and formulations of CSHT, as well as the paucity of prospective cohort studies, limits knowledge of any associations between CSHT and CVD.",success

Ideal cardiovascular health, a concept well supported in the literature, is defined by the presence of both ideal health behaviors (nonsmoking, body mass index <25 kg/m(2), physical activity at goal levels, and pursuit of a diet consistent with current guideline recommendations) and ideal health factors (untreated total cholesterol <200 mg/dL, untreated blood pressure <120/<80 mm Hg, and fasting blood glucose <100 mg/dL). Appropriate levels for children are also provided. With the use of levels that span the entire range of the same metrics, cardiovascular health status for the whole population is defined as poor, intermediate, or ideal. These metrics will be monitored to determine the changing prevalence of cardiovascular health status and define achievement of the Impact Goal. In addition, the committee recommends goals for further reductions in cardiovascular disease and stroke mortality. Thus, the committee recommends the following Impact Goals: ""By 2020, to improve the cardiovascular health of all Americans by 20% while reducing deaths from cardiovascular diseases and stroke by 20%."" These goals will require new strategic directions for the American Heart Association in its research, clinical, public health, and advocacy programs for cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention in the next decade and beyond.",success

This renewed interest in health promotion and disease prevention has not been without its critics. Some critics have accused proponents of life-style interventions of promoting a victim-blaming ideology by neglecting the importance of social influences on health and disease. This article proposes an ecological model for health promotion which focuses attention on both individual and social environmental factors as targets for health promotion interventions. It addresses the importance of interventions directed at changing interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy, factors which support and maintain unhealthy behaviors. The model assumes that appropriate changes in the social environment will produce changes in individuals, and that the support of individuals in the population is essential for implementing environmental changes.",success

Development of interventions requires attention to the etiology of these differences. This study examined associations among sexual orientation discrimination, cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder (TUD) in the United States. We used data from the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions based on in-person interviews with a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized US adults. Approximately 8.3% of the target population was estimated to have same-sex sexual attraction, 3.1% had at least one same-sex sexual partner in the past-year, and 2.8% self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Sexual attraction, sexual behavior, and sexual identity were significantly associated with cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and DSM-5 TUD. Risk of all tobacco/nicotine outcomes was most pronounced for bisexual adults across all three sexual orientation dimensions. Approximately half of sexual minorities who identified as lesbian or gay and one-fourth of those who identified as bisexual reported past-year sexual orientation discrimination. Sexual minorities who experienced high levels of past-year sexual orientation discrimination had significantly greater probability of past-year cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and TUD relative to sexual minorities who experienced lower levels of sexual orientation discrimination or no discrimination. Sexual minorities, especially bisexual adults, are at heightened risk of cigarette smoking, any tobacco/nicotine use, and DSM-5 TUD across all three major sexual orientation dimensions. Tobacco prevention and cessation efforts should target bisexual adults and consider the role that sexual orientation discrimination plays in cigarette smoking and treatment of TUD. Differences in tobacco/nicotine use by sexual orientation are well documented, but little is known about differences across all three sexual orientation dimensions (attraction, behavior, and identity) or the origins of these differences. This study is the first to show that differences in tobacco/nicotine use across the three sexual orientation dimensions for respondents who were exclusively heterosexually-oriented were minimal, but varied more substantially among sexual minority women and men across the three sexual orientation dimensions.

This secondary analysis was restricted to 3458 individuals who self-identified as transgender or gender nonconforming and provided complete data on study variables. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine health risks by level of reported family rejection (low/moderate/high), controlling for relevant sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, 42.3% of the sample reported a suicide attempt and 26.3% reported misusing drugs or alcohol to cope with transgender-related discrimination. After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex assigned at birth, binary gender identity, income, education, and employment status, family rejection was associated with increased odds of both behaviors. Odds increased significantly with increasing levels of family rejection. Family rejection related to gender identity is an understudied interpersonal stressor that may negatively affect health outcomes for transgender and gender nonconforming individuals.

The aim of this study was to examine sexual identity differences in CVH among women and the role of ALE. In the Epidemiologic Study of Risk in Women, we used multinomial logistic regression to assess sexual identity differences (SMW vs heterosexual women [reference group]) in CVH markers (ideal vs poor, intermediate vs poor) using the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 metric and the total score. Next, we tested whether the association of sexual identity with the total CVH score was attenuated by traditional CVD risk factors or ALE. The sample consisted of 867 women (395 heterosexual, 472 SMW). Sexual minority women were more likely to have experienced discrimination (P < .001) and lifetime sexual abuse (P < .001) than heterosexual women. Sexual minority women were also less likely to meet ideal CVH criteria for current tobacco use (adjusted odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.73) or intermediate CVH criteria for body mass index (adjusted odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.92). Sexual minority women had a lower cumulative CVH score (B [SE] = -0.35 [0.14], P < .01) than heterosexual women. This difference was not explained by traditional CVD risk factors or ALE.

Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine correlates of trauma. Next, multiple logistic regression was used to examine the associations of different forms of trauma throughout the life course (childhood, adulthood, and lifetime), with psychosocial and behavioral risk factors and self-reported cardiometabolic risk (obesity, hypertension, and diabetes) in SMW adjusted for relevant covariates. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 547 participants were included. Older age was associated with higher rates of childhood and adulthood trauma. SMW of color reported higher rates of childhood trauma than white participants. Higher education was associated with lower rates of adulthood trauma. All forms of trauma were associated with probable diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and lower perceived social support. Adult trauma was associated with anxiety, whereas childhood and lifetime trauma were associated with higher odds of depression. No significant associations between forms of trauma and behavioral risk factors were noted, except that childhood trauma was associated with higher odds of past-3-month overeating. Logistic regression models examining the association of trauma and cardiometabolic risk revealed that childhood trauma was an independent risk factor for diabetes. Adulthood and lifetime trauma were significantly associated with obesity and hypertension. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Trauma emerged as an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic risk in SMW.

Six databases were systematically reviewed from inception through February 2018 for studies with adult subjects, focusing on cardiovascular health indicators among social groups stigmatized because of their gender, race/ethnicity, age, body weight/obesity, or sexual orientation. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality and risk of bias for nonrandomized studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration 7-item domain for randomized controlled and experimental trials. The search identified 84 eligible studies published between 1984 and 2017. Studies retrieved were categorized according to demonstrated links between stigma and cardiovascular disease risk factors including blood pressure (n = 45), heart rate variability (n = 6), blood/saliva cardiovascular biomarkers (n = 18), as well as other indicators of cardiovascular health (n = 15). Based on the findings from included studies, 86% concluded that there was a significant relationship among stigma or discrimination and cardiovascular health indicators among socially stigmatized groups. However, there were varying degrees of evidence supporting these relationships, depending on the type of discrimination and cardiovascular health indicator. The current evidence implies an association between perceived discrimination and cardiovascular health. However, a majority of these studies are cross-sectional (73%) and focus on racial discrimination (79%), while using a wide variety of measurements to assess social discrimination and cardiovascular health.

Rates of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and other CVD manifestations, including pulmonary hypertension and sudden cardiac death, are significantly higher for people living with HIV than for uninfected control subjects, even in the setting of HIV viral suppression with effective antiretroviral therapy. These elevated risks generally persist after demographic and clinical risk factors are accounted for and may be partly attributed to chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Data on long-term CVD outcomes in HIV are limited by the relatively recent epidemiological transition of HIV to a chronic disease. Therefore, our understanding of CVD pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment in HIV relies on large observational studies, randomized controlled trials of HIV therapies that are underpowered to detect CVD end points, and small interventional studies examining surrogate CVD end points. The purpose of this document is to provide a thorough review of the existing evidence on HIV-associated CVD, in particular atherosclerotic CVD (including myocardial infarction and stroke) and heart failure, as well as pragmatic recommendations on how to approach CVD prevention and treatment in HIV in the absence of large-scale randomized controlled trial data.

A literature research was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, searching for relevant articles on the effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy on cardiometabolic risk and thrombosis. After screening 734 abstracts, 77 full text articles were retained, of which 11 were review articles. Studies describing a higher risk for cardiometabolic and thromboembolic morbidity and/or mortality in transgender women (but not transgender men) mainly covered data on transgender women using the now obsolete ethinyl estradiol and, therefore, are no longer valid. Currently, most of the available literature on transgender people adhering to standard treatment regimens consists of retrospective cohort studies of insufficient follow-up duration.

The majority of transgender competitive sport policies that were reviewed were not evidence based. Currently, there is no direct or consistent research suggesting transgender female individuals (or male individuals) have an athletic advantage at any stage of their transition (e.g. cross-sex hormones, gender-confirming surgery) and, therefore, competitive sport policies that place restrictions on transgender people need to be considered and potentially revised.",success

Data come from Wave IV (2008-2009) of the National Longitudinal Study for Adolescent Health (N=12,451), a prospective nationally representative study of U.S. adolescents followed into young adulthood (mean age=28.9 years). A total of 520 respondents identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Biomarkers included C-reactive protein, glycosylated hemoglobin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate. Analyses were conducted in 2012. In gender-stratified models adjusted for demographics (age, race/ethnicity); SES (income, education); health behaviors (smoking, regular physical activity, alcohol consumption); and BMI, gay and bisexual men had significant elevations in C-reactive protein, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate, compared to heterosexual men. Despite having more risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and higher BMI, lesbians and bisexual women had lower levels of C-reactive protein than heterosexual women in fully adjusted models. Evidence was found for sexual orientation disparities in biomarkers of cardiovascular risk among young adults, particularly in gay and bisexual men. These findings, if confirmed in other studies, suggest that disruptions in core physiologic processes that ultimately confer risk for cardiovascular disease may occur early in the life course for sexual-minority men.",success

Of the participants, 1,267 identified as lesbian or bisexual and 92,983 identified as heterosexual. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model incidence of type 2 diabetes. LB women had a 27% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than heterosexual women (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.05, 1.54). Differences between LB women and heterosexual women in risk of type 2 diabetes were greater during younger ages (sexual orientation-by-age interaction, <i>P</i> < 0.001). BMI mediated the relationship between sexual orientation and type 2 diabetes; the IRR was completely attenuated when BMI was added to the model (IRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70, 1.03).

Vessel wall (cellular) components contribute adhesion molecules that recruit circulating leukocytes and platelets to sites of vascular damage, tissue factor, which provides a procoagulant signal of vascular breach, and a surface upon which coagulation complexes are assembled. Blood flow is often characterized by 2 key variables: shear rate and shear stress. Shear rate affects several aspects of coagulation, including transport rates of platelets and plasma proteins to and from the injury site, platelet activation, and the kinetics of fibrin monomer formation and polymerization. Shear stress modulates adhesion rates of platelets and expression of adhesion molecules and procoagulant activity on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. That no one abnormality in any component of Virchow's triad fully predicts coagulopathy a priori suggests coagulopathies are complex, multifactorial, and interactive. In this review, we focus on contributions of blood composition, vascular cells, and blood flow to hemostasis and thrombosis, and suggest that cross-talk among the 3 components of Virchow's triad is necessary for hemostasis and determines propensity for thrombosis or bleeding. Investigative models that permit interplay among these components are necessary to understand the operant pathophysiology, and effectively treat and prevent thrombotic and bleeding disorders.",success
27189130,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. VTE is the leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life years and the third leading cause of cardiovascular death in the world. DVT leads to post-thrombotic syndrome, whereas pulmonary embolism can cause chronic pulmonary hypertension, both of which reduce quality of life. Genetic and acquired risk factors for thrombosis include non-O blood groups, factor V Leiden mutation, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, advanced age, surgery, hospitalization and long-haul travel. A combination of blood stasis, plasma hypercoagulability and endothelial dysfunction is thought to trigger thrombosis, which starts most often in the valve pockets of large veins. Animal studies have revealed pathogenic roles for leukocytes, platelets, tissue factor-positive microvesicles, neutrophil extracellular traps and factors XI and XII. Diagnosis of VTE requires testing and exclusion of other pathologies, and typically involves laboratory measures (such as D-dimer) and diagnostic imaging. VTE is treated with anticoagulants and occasionally with thrombolytics to prevent thrombus extension and to reduce thrombus size. Anticoagulants are also used to reduce recurrence. New therapies with improved safety profiles are needed to prevent and treat venous thrombosis. For an illustrated summary of this Primer, visit: http://go.nature.com/8ZyCuY.",success

A well-known example is the factor V Leiden (FVL) paradox: the FVL mutation poses a clearly higher risk for deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) than for pulmonary embolism. We aimed to expand this paradox and therefore present risk estimates for several established risk factors for DVT and pulmonary embolism separately. When such separate risk estimates could not be retrieved from the literature, we calculated these risks in our own data, a large population-based case-control study on venous thrombosis (the MEGA study). Our results showed that the FVL paradox can be broadened (ie, the risk factors oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, puerperium, minor leg injuries, and obesity have an effect comparable with FVL). Furthermore, we found that pulmonary conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and sickle cell disease, were risk factors with an opposite effect: a higher risk of pulmonary embolism, but little or no effect on DVT. These findings suggest that pulmonary embolism and DVT may not always have the same etiology, and encourage unraveling this phenomenon in further studies.",success

Nonetheless, even with the DOACs, bleeding still occurs and many patients with atrial fibrillation fail to receive anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis because of the fear of bleeding. Therefore, there is an urgent need for safer anticoagulants. Recent investigations into the biochemistry of hemostasis and thrombosis have identified new targets for development of novel anticoagulants. Using data from complementary sources, including epidemiological studies and investigations in various animal models, the contact pathway has emerged as a potential mediator of thrombosis that plays a minor part in hemostasis. Consequently, factor (F) XII of the contact system and FXI in the intrinsic pathway have been identified as potentially safer targets of anticoagulation than thrombin or FXa. However, further studies are needed to identify which is the better target for the appropriate indication. This review highlights the evidence for focusing on FXI and FXII and examines the novel approaches directed at these new targets. These emerging strategies should address current unmet medical needs and provide new avenues by which to improve anticoagulant therapy by reducing the risk of bleeding.",success

Specific plasma clot composition differs between individuals and may change in disease states. However, the plasma clot proteome has not yet been in-depth analyzed, mainly due to technical difficulty related to the presence of a highly abundant protein-fibrinogen and fibrin that forms a plasma clot. The aim of our study was to optimize quantitative proteomic analysis of fibrin clots prepared ex vivo from citrated plasma of the peripheral blood drawn from patients with prior venous thromboembolism (VTE). We used a multiple enzyme digestion filter aided sample preparation, a multienzyme digestion (MED) FASP method combined with LC-MS/MS analysis performed on a Proxeon Easy-nLC System coupled to the Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer. We also evaluated the impact of peptide fractionation with pipet-tip strong anion exchange (SAX) method on the obtained results. Our proteomic approach revealed 476 proteins repeatedly identified in the plasma fibrin clots from patients with VTE including extracellular vesicle-derived proteins, lipoproteins, fibrinolysis inhibitors, and proteins involved in immune responses. The MED FASP method using three different enzymes: LysC, trypsin and chymotrypsin increased the number of identified peptides and proteins and their sequence coverage as compared to a single step digestion. Peptide fractionation with a pipet-tip strong anion exchange (SAX) protocol increased the depth of proteomic analyses, but also extended the time needed for sample analysis with LC-MS/MS.

Genetics explains only a part of VTE hereditability and not defined molecular causes are found in approximately 50% of thrombotic patients. Thus, a major understanding of molecular mechanisms may clarify the missing hereditability. Concerning epigenetics, a particular histone modification (citrullination) plays a key role in increasing the rate of venous occlusive events by inducing neutrophil apoptosis and expulsion of neutrophil extra-cellular traps (NETs), which may be useful biomarkers of active disease. Moreover, an over-expression of miR-320a/b, miR-582, miR-195, miR-424-5p, and miR-532, or a down-regulation of miR495, miR-136-5p and miR-26a may improve the accuracy of VTE diagnosis. No clinical studies have focused on DNA methylation in VTE. Nowadays, no validated epigenetics biomarkers are routinely used for diagnosis and prevention of VTE. In the era of personalized therapy, several clinical trials are investigating the putative role of statins, a class of lipid-lowering epigenetic-based drugs, as additional therapeutic agents in VTE. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2C9, VKORC1, and MIR133 genes can help physicians to predict individual warfarin dose requirement. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in the control of blood clot development is crucial to design novel therapeutic strategies.

25379629,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) are increasingly-recognized health conditions in children, with both acute and chronic sequelae. Risk factors for, and pathogenesis of, VTE are readily related to three principal factors, consisting of venous stasis, endothelial damage, and the hypercoagulable state (i.e. thrombophilia), termed the triad of Virchow. In children, greater than 90% of VTE are provoked by an overt clinical risk factor, the most common of which is a central venous catheter. Risk factors for childhood-onset (beyond the neonatal period) AIS include sickle cell disease, infection, cerebral arteriopathy, and congenital cardiac disease. In perinatal AIS, risk factors are less well-defined, and have been hypothesized to include maternal-fetal conditions. While some acquired and inherited thrombophilias have been associated with increased risk of incident and/or recurrent VTE and AIS, knowledge of other diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of VTE/AIS in children remains quite limited. To date, very few published studies have employed plasma mass spectrometry-based ""omics"" approaches (proteomics, lipidomics or metabolomics). Ongoing and future research efforts involving multicenter prospective study-derived plasma biobanks in pediatric VTE (such as the Kids-DOTT trial) and AIS (including VIPS) along with new multi-omics-compatible sample processing methods offer fertile opportunities for discovery and validation of both novel risk factors and prognostic markers, with great potential to achieve improved prognostic stratification in these diseases.",success

Using the Scripps Venous Thrombosis Registry population for a case-control study, we discovered that 10:1 and 16:1 acylcarnitines were low in plasmas of the VTE patient group compared with matched controls, respectively. Data from targeted metabolomics studies showed that several long-chain acylcarnitines (10:1, 12:0, 12:2, 18:1, and 18:2) were lower in the VTE group. Clotting assays were used to evaluate a causal relationship for low acylcarnitines in patients with VTE. Various acylcarnitines inhibited factor Xa-initiated clotting. Inhibition of factor Xa by acylcarnitines was greater for longer acyl chains. Mechanistic studies showed that 16:0 acylcarnitine had anticoagulant activity in the absence of factor Va or phospholipids. Surface plasmon resonance investigations revealed that 16:0 acylcarnitine was bound to factor Xa and that binding did not require the γ-carboxy glutamic acid domain.

Fifty-nine patients (63±14 years) with acute main or lower lobe pulmonary embolism and echocardiographic RV to left ventricular dimension (RV/LV) ratio ≥1.0 were randomized to receive unfractionated heparin and an USAT regimen of 10 to 20 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator over 15 hours (n=30; USAT group) or unfractionated heparin alone (n=29; heparin group). Primary outcome was the difference in the RV/LV ratio from baseline to 24 hours. Safety outcomes included death, major and minor bleeding, and recurrent venous thromboembolism at 90 days. In the USAT group, the mean RV/LV ratio was reduced from 1.28±0.19 at baseline to 0.99±0.17 at 24 hours (P<0.001); in the heparin group, mean RV/LV ratios were 1.20±0.14 and 1.17±0.20, respectively (P=0.31).

We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients with an incident diagnosis of venous thromboembolism between January 2010 and December 2016 using OptumInsight's Clinformatics Data Mart. We identified the first filled oral anticoagulant prescription within 30 days of discharge of an inpatient admission. We performed a multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, zip code-linked household income, and clinical covariates to identify factors associated with the use of DOACs. Race and ethnicity were determined in this database through a combination of public records, self-report, and proprietary ethnicity code tables. There were 14 140 patients included in the analysis.

Randomised controlled trials which compared the effect on postoperative complications of different preoperative fasting regimens on adults were included. Details of the eligible studies were independently extracted by two reviewers and where relevant information was unavailable from the text attempts were made to contact the authors. Thirty eight randomised controlled comparisons (made within 22 trials) were identified. Most were based on 'healthy' adult participants who were not considered to be at increased risk of regurgitation or aspiration during anaesthesia. Few trials reported the incidence of aspiration/regurgitation or related morbidity but relied on indirect measures of patient safety i.e. intra-operative gastric volume and pH. There was no evidence that the volume or pH of participants' gastric contents differed significantly depending on whether the groups were permitted a shortened preoperative fluid fast or continued a standard fast. Fluids evaluated included water, coffee, fruit juice, clear fluids and other drinks (e.g. isotonic drink, carbohydrate drink). Participants given a drink of water preoperatively were found to have a significantly lower volume of gastric contents than the groups that followed a standard fasting regimen. This difference was modest and clinically insignificant. There was no indication that the volume of fluid permitted during the preoperative period (i.e. low or high) resulted in a difference in outcomes from those participants that followed a standard fast. Few trials specifically investigated the preoperative fasting regimen for patient populations considered to be at increased risk during anaesthesia of regurgitation/aspiration and related morbidity.

We studied 379 patients included in the GIPS-III trial in which patients without diabetes or renal dysfunction, who underwent primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for STEMI, were randomized to metformin 500 mg or placebo twice daily for four months. At baseline and at seven scheduled visits up to four months after PCI, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined (2582 values). Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.3 mg/dl or 25 % rise within 48 h after PCI. At all visits, the mean eGFR was similar in patients randomized to metformin or placebo. Over the four month period, mixed-effect repeated-measures model analysis showed a least-squares mean ± standard error change in eGFR of -5.9±0.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the metformin group and −7.1 ±0.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the control group (P=0.27 for overall interaction). The incidence of CI-AKI was 14.8 %; 29 (15.2 %) patients in the metformin group versus 27 (14.4 %) controls (P=0.89). After adjustment for covariates, metformin treatment was not associated with CI-AKI (odds ratio: 0.96, 95%CI 0.52−1.75, P=0.88). We conclude that initiation of metformin shortly after primary PCI has no adverse effect on renal function in patients without diabetes or prior renal impairment, further providing evidence of the safety of metformin use after myocardial infarction and subsequent contrast exposure.",success

Our study was designed as a single-centered, randomized, and observational study including 268 patients undergoing elective CAG with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of >60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Of these patients, 134 continued metformin treatment during angiography, whereas 134 discontinued it 24 h before the procedure. CIN was defined as either a 25% relative increase in serum creatinine levels from the baseline or a 0.5 mg/dL increase in the absolute value that measured 48 h after CAG. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of CIN and LA after CAG. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographics and laboratory values. CIN at 48 h was 8% (11/134) in the metformin continued group and 6% (8/134) in the metformin discontinued group (p=0.265). Patients in neither of the groups developed metformin-induced LA.

To assess the incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis, and to evaluate blood lactate levels, for those on metformin treatment compared to placebo or non-metformin therapies. A comprehensive search was performed of electronic databases to identify studies of metformin treatment. The search was augmented by scanning references of identified articles, and by contacting principal investigators. Prospective trials and observational cohort studies in patients with type 2 diabetes of least one month duration were included if they evaluated metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, compared to placebo or any other glucose-lowering therapy. The incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis was recorded as cases per patient-years, for metformin treatment and for non-metformin treatments. The upper limit for the true incidence of cases was calculated using Poisson statistics. In a second analysis lactate levels were measured as a net change from baseline or as mean treatment values (basal and stimulated by food or exercise) for treatment and comparison groups. The pooled results were recorded as a weighted mean difference (WMD) in mmol/L, using the fixed-effect model for continuous data. Pooled data from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies revealed no cases of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis in 70,490 patient-years of metformin use or in 55,451 patients-years in the non-metformin group. Using Poisson statistics the upper limit for the true incidence of lactic acidosis per 100,000 patient-years was 4.3 cases in the metformin group and 5.4 cases in the non-metformin group.

Decreased eGFRs, periprocedural hypotension, higher contrast media volumes, lower baseline hematocrit, diabetes, pulmonary edema at presentation, intra-aortic balloon pump use, and ejection fraction <40% were the most significant predictors of CIN in patients with CKD. Apart from intra-aortic balloon pump use, predictors of CIN in patients without CKD were the same as mentioned, plus older age and type of contrast media. Regardless of baseline renal function, CIN correlated with longer in-hospital stay and higher rates of in-hospital complications and 1-year mortality compared with patients without CIN. By multivariate analysis, CIN was 1 of the most powerful predictors of 1-year mortality in patients with preexisting CKD (odds ratio 2.37, 95% confidence interval 1.63 to 3.44) or preserved eGFR (odds ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.22 to 2.60).

In recent years, several relatively expensive monomeric nonionic iodinated compounds having approximately half the osmolality of the corresponding ionic compounds and a lower reaction rate have become available. With our two-dose corticosteroid regimen, the incidence of reactions necessitating therapy in patients receiving the ionic medium approximated that reported in an unblinded nonrandomized study of patients receiving a newer intravenous nonionic medium without corticosteroid pretreatment. We conclude that the much less expensive ionic medium, if administered with corticosteroid pretreatment, may serve as a reasonable alternative to intravenous nonionic medium, without loss of safety.",success

Subjects (n = 202) who completed an accelerated 5-hour intravenous corticosteroid premedication regimen before low-osmolality contrast-enhanced CT for a prior allergic-like or unknown-type reaction to iodine-based contrast material from June 1, 2008, to June 30, 2016, were identified. The breakthrough reaction rate was compared by using the Farrington and Manning noninferiority likelihood score to test subjects premedicated with a traditional 13-hour oral regimen (2.1% [13 of 626]). All subjects were premedicated for a prior allergic-like or unknown-type reaction to iodine-based contrast material. A noninferiority margin of 4.0% was selected to allow for no more than a clinically negligible 6.0% breakthrough reaction rate in the cohort that received 5-hour intravenous corticosteroid prophylaxis. Results The breakthrough reaction rate for 5-hour intravenous prophylaxis was 2.5% (five of 202 patients; 95% confidence interval: 0.8%, 5.7%), which was noninferior to the 2.1% (13 of 626 patients; 95% confidence interval: 1.1%, 3.5%) rate for the 13-hour regimen (P = .0181). The upper limits of the confidence interval for the difference between the two rates was 3.7% (0.4%; 95% confidence interval: -1.6%, 3.7%), which was within the 4.0% noninferiority margin.

Levels of anxiety and sedation, heart rate, respiratory rate (RR), mean blood pressure (MBP), and oxygen saturation (Sp(O2)) were measured before and 15 min after midazolam administration. A higher level of preoperative anxiety was more often observed in women than in men, and in young than in older patients. The female or younger patients showed significant anxiolytic benefits from midazolam. A deeper sedation level was found in men compared with women. Forty-two of 45 patients (93.3%) with excessive sedation received midazolam 0.06 mg kg(-1).

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multi- component non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients. Two review authors examined titles and abstracts of citations identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data independently, with any disagreements settled by consensus. The primary outcome was incidence of delirium; secondary outcomes included duration and severity of delirium, institutional care at discharge, quality of life and healthcare costs. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes; and between group mean differences and standard deviations for continuous outcomes. We included 39 trials that recruited 16,082 participants, assessing 22 different interventions or comparisons. Fourteen trials were placebo-controlled, 15 evaluated a delirium prevention intervention against usual care, and 10 compared two different interventions. Thirty-two studies were conducted in patients undergoing surgery, the majority in orthopaedic settings. Seven studies were conducted in general medical or geriatric medicine settings.We found multi-component interventions reduced the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; seven studies; 1950 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

Secondary outcomes will be assessed until the first postoperative day and then 30 days after surgery. They comprise among other things: functional and cognitive recovery, postoperative delirium, health-related quality of life assessment, and mortality or new onset of serious cardiac or pulmonary complications, acute stroke, or acute kidney injury. Analysis will adhere to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary outcome will be analysed with the use of mixed linear models including treatment effect and study centre as factors and random effects for blocks. Exploratory adjusted and subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes with regard to gender effects, frailty, pre-operative anxiety level, patient demographics, and surgery experience will also be performed.

We performed a retrospective analysis of safety data in AMI patients with recently placed coronary artery stents enrolled in a multi-center phase II trial for gadoversetamide. Patients underwent 1.5 T CMR within 16 days of PCI. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) and ECGs were taken pre-CMR, 1, 2, and 24 h post-CMR. Any major adverse cardiac event (MACE) or other serious adverse events in the first 24 h after MRI were recorded. There were 258 stents in 211 AMI patients. The mean delay to CMR following PCI was 6.5 ± 4 days, with 62 patients (29 %) receiving CMR within 3 days and 132 patients (63 %) within 1 week. Patients showed no significant vital sign changes following CMR. Ten patients (4.7 %) showed mild, transient ECG changes.

Among samples with hypertension in trials of higher study quality, CET rivals aerobic exercise training as antihypertensive therapy. Because of the moderate quality of this literature, additional randomized controlled CET trials that examine BP as a primary outcome among samples with hypertension are warranted to confirm our promising findings.",success

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) DASH diet; (2) RCT; (3) risk factors including systolic and diastolic BP and glucose, HDL, LDL, TAG and total cholesterol concentrations; (4) control group. Random-effects models were used to determine the pooled effect sizes. Meta-regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between effect sizes, baseline values of the risk factors, BMI, age, quality of trials, salt intake and study duration. A total of twenty articles reporting data for 1917 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The duration of interventions ranged from 2 to 24 weeks. The DASH diet was found to result in significant decreases in systolic BP ( - 5·2 mmHg, 95% CI - 7·0, - 3·4; P< 0·001) and diastolic BP ( - 2·6 mmHg, 95% CI - 3·5, - 1·7; P< 0·001) and in the concentrations of total cholesterol ( - 0·20 mmol/l, 95% CI - 0·31, - 0·10; P< 0·001) and LDL ( - 0·10 mmol/l, 95% CI - 0·20, - 0·01; P= 0·03). Changes in both systolic and diastolic BP were greater in participants with higher baseline BP or BMI. These changes predicted a reduction of approximately 13% in the 10-year Framingham risk score for CVD.

Later observational studies have confirmed the benefits of adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors but clinical trial evidence is more limited. To determine the effectiveness of a Mediterranean-style diet for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 25 September 2018); Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2018 week 39); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters, 1900 to 26 September 2018); DARE Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library); HTA Issue 4 of 4, 2016 (Cochrane Library); NHS EED Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library). We searched trial registers and applied no language restrictions. We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with established CVD (secondary prevention). Both of the following key components were required to reach our definition of a Mediterranean-style diet: high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio (use of olive oil as main cooking ingredient and/or consumption of other traditional foods high in monounsaturated fats such as tree nuts) and a high intake of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables and legumes. Additional components included: low to moderate red wine consumption; high consumption of whole grains and cereals; low consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish; moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The intervention could be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, usual care or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow-up periods of three months or more defined as the intervention period plus post intervention follow-up. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted four main comparisons:1. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal intervention for primary prevention;2. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for primary prevention;3. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus usual care for secondary prevention;4. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary intervention for secondary prevention. In this substantive review update, 30 RCTs (49 papers) (12,461 participants randomised) and seven ongoing trials met our inclusion criteria. The majority of trials contributed to primary prevention: comparisons 1 (nine trials) and 2 (13 trials). Secondary prevention trials were included for comparison 3 (two trials) and comparison 4 (four trials plus an additional two trials that were excluded from the main analyses due to published concerns regarding the reliability of the data).Two trials reported on adverse events where these were absent or minor (low- to moderate-quality evidence). No trials reported on costs or health-related quality of life.Primary preventionThe included studies for comparison 1 did not report on clinical endpoints (CVD mortality, total mortality or non-fatal endpoints such as myocardial infarction or stroke). The PREDIMED trial (included in comparison 2) was retracted and re-analysed following concerns regarding randomisation at two of 11 sites. Low-quality evidence shows little or no effect of the PREDIMED (7747 randomised) intervention (advice to follow a Mediterranean diet plus supplemental extra-virgin olive oil or tree nuts) compared to a low-fat diet on CVD mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.32) or total mortality (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24) over 4.8 years. There was, however, a reduction in the number of strokes with the PREDIMED intervention (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.80), a decrease from 24/1000 to 14/1000 (95% CI 11 to 19), moderate-quality evidence). For CVD risk factors for comparison 1 there was low-quality evidence for a possible small reduction in total cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.32 to 0.00) and moderate-quality evidence for a reduction in systolic (-2.99 mmHg (95% CI -3.45 to -2.53) and diastolic blood pressure (-2.0 mmHg, 95% CI -2.29 to -1.71), with low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. For comparison 2 there was moderate-quality evidence of a possible small reduction in LDL cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.02) and triglycerides (-0.09 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01) with moderate or low-quality evidence of little or no effect on total or HDL cholesterol or blood pressure.Secondary preventionFor secondary prevention, the Lyon Diet Heart Study (comparison 3) examined the effect of advice to follow a Mediterranean diet and supplemental canola margarine compared to usual care in 605 CHD patients over 46 months and there was low-quality evidence of a reduction in adjusted estimates for CVD mortality (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.82) and total mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.92) with the intervention. Only one small trial (101 participants) provided unadjusted estimates for composite clinical endpoints for comparison 4 (very low-quality evidence of uncertain effect). For comparison 3 there was low-quality evidence of little or no effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on lipid levels and very low-quality evidence for blood pressure. Similarly, for comparison 4 where only two trials contributed to the analyses there was low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect of the intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure. Despite the relatively large number of studies included in this review, there is still some uncertainty regarding the effects of a Mediterranean-style diet on clinical endpoints and CVD risk factors for both primary and secondary prevention. The quality of evidence for the modest benefits on CVD risk factors in primary prevention is low or moderate, with a small number of studies reporting minimal harms. There is a paucity of evidence for secondary prevention. The ongoing studies may provide more certainty in the future.",success

Nevertheless, smoking, affecting arterial stiffness and wave reflection might have greater detrimental effect on central blood pressure, which is more closely related to target organ damage than brachial blood pressure.

We also searched reference lists of identified articles and published meta-analyses and reviews. We included full-text articles with original human trial data for the effect of a change of alcohol consumption on blood pressure in adults, which reported a quantifiable change in average alcohol consumption that lasted at least 7 days and a corresponding change in blood pressure. We extracted data from published reports. We did random-effects meta-analyses stratified by amount of alcohol intake at baseline. All meta-analyses were done with Stata (version 14.1). For the UK, we modelled the effect of a reduction of alcohol consumption for 50% of the population drinking more than two standard drinks per day (ie, 12 g pure alcohol per drink). 36 trials with 2865 participants (2464 men and 401 women) were included. In people who drank two or fewer drinks per day, a reduction in alcohol was not associated with a significant reduction in blood pressure; however, in people who drank more than two drinks per day, a reduction in alcohol intake was associated with increased blood pressure reduction. Reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean difference -5·50 mm Hg, 95% CI -6·70 to -4·30) and diastolic blood pressure (-3·97, -4·70 to -3·25) was strongest in participants who drank six or more drinks per day if they reduced their intake by about 50%. For the UK, the results would translate into more than 7000 inpatient hospitalisations and 678 cardiovascular deaths prevented every year. Reducing alcohol intake lowers blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent threshold effect. Implementation of effective alcohol interventions in people who drink more than two drinks per day would reduce the disease burden from both alcohol consumption and hypertension, and should be prioritised in countries with substantial alcohol-attributable risk.

Regular exercise has been recommended as a strategy for the prevention and treatment of hypertension because of its effects in reducing clinical blood pressure; however, ambulatory blood pressure is a better predictor of target-organ damage than clinical blood pressure, and therefore studying the effects of exercise on ambulatory blood pressure is important as well. Moreover, different kinds of exercise might produce distinct effects that might differ between normotensive and hypertensive subjects.The aim of this study was to review the current literature on the acute and chronic effects of aerobic and resistance exercise on ambulatory blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. It has been conclusively shown that a single episode of aerobic exercise reduces ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Similarly, regular aerobic training also decreases ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive individuals. In contrast, data on the effects of resistance exercise is both scarce and controversial. Nevertheless, studies suggest that resistance exercise might acutely decrease ambulatory blood pressure after exercise, and that this effect seems to be greater after low-intensity exercise and in patients receiving anti-hypertensive drugs. On the other hand, only two studies investigating resistance training in hypertensive patients have been conducted, and neither has demonstrated any hypotensive effect. Thus, based on current knowledge, aerobic training should be recommended to decrease ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, while resistance exercise could be prescribed as a complementary strategy.",success

16796393,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Prolonged presence of elevated plasma triglycerides (TGs) during the postprandial period has been suggested to increase the risk for coronary artery disease. Aerobic exercise attenuates postprandial lipaemia and this has generally been described as a short-term effect of the exercise. Effects of exercise on postprandial lipaemia have mostly been investigated, and documented, with large exercise-induced energy expenditures (i.e. 1000 kcal). The exact mechanisms involved in the attenuation of postprandial lipaemia with exercise are not completely understood, but it appears that at least two mechanisms are involved: a decrease in TG secretion by the liver and an increase in plasma TG clearance by the muscle. Changes in the metabolism of other lipids, such as those in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been documented only when the exercise is performed some hours before the fat meal. Although factors such as the physical fitness and percentage body fat of an individual are likely to also be involved, the most important factors determining the magnitude of the attenuation in postprandial lipaemia appear to be the magnitude of the exercise-induced energy expenditure and the intensity of exercise. To date, the evidence suggests that healthy individuals can generally induce favourable changes in postprandial lipaemia with aerobic exercise that: (i) is completed during the period extending from 16 hours before a meal through 1.5 hours after a meal; (ii) is of moderate intensity; and (iii) results in an energy expenditure of approximately 500 kcal (or more).",success

Exercise-induced changes in the blood lipid profile appear to be therapeutic, an observation favouring the integration of exercise in CHD prevention and treatment programmes. The specific stimuli needed to produce such therapeutic effects are yet to be elucidated; both the repeated, transitory effects of single, isolated exercise sessions and exercise training effects are likely to be involved. The focus of this article is on the acute or short term changes of a single session of exercise on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. The short term, exercise-induced changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins are reviewed in the context of the role various lipid classifications play in coronary artery disease, the many potentially confounding variables that are ever-present, and the relative effects of gender, exercise modality, and exercise intensity. It is concluded that a single bout of exercise has the potential to induce short term, transient increases in the high density lipoproteins HDL and HDL2 and decreases in triglycerides in men. For women, more research is needed to determine clearly the exercise induced short term changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins. It appears that duration and intensity of exercise are directly related to the degree of changes observed: bouts of prolonged, intense exercise of sufficient energy expenditure appear to induce decreases in triglycerides and increases in HDL, primarily through HDL2, of greater magnitude and duration. Exercise induced changes in the plasma lipid profile appear to have returned to pre-exercise levels by 48 hours postexercise. Recognising that the underlying physiological mechanisms for changes in lipids and lipoproteins remain inconclusive, the roles of the lipid-regulatory enzymes lipoprotein lipase, lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase, and hepatic triglyceride lipase are discussed.

This will help establish realistic expectations and maximize improvements in CV risk factors. Although the minimum guidelines for aerobic PA (150 min of moderate or 75 min of vigorous physical activity per week) can improve CV health, these levels are generally inadequate for clinically significant weight loss or weight maintenance without caloric restriction. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of ET to promote clinically significant weight loss and promote weight maintenance.

Early in the process, the DGAC developed a conceptual model and formulated questions to examine nutritional risk and determinants and impact of dietary patterns in relation to numerous health outcomes among individuals aged ≥2 y. As detailed in the report, an expansive, transparent, and comprehensive process was used to address each question, with multiple opportunities for public input included. Consensus was reached on all DGAC's findings, including each conclusion and recommendation, and the entire report. When research questions were answered by original systematic literature reviews and/or with existing, high-quality expert reports, the quality and strength of the evidence was formally graded. The report was organized around the following 5 themes: 1) food and nutrient intakes and health: current status and trends; 2) dietary patterns, foods and nutrients, and health outcomes; 3) diet and physical activity behavior change; 4) food and physical activity environments; and 5) food sustainability and food safety. The following 3 cross-cutting topics were addressed: 1) sodium, 2) saturated fat, and 3) added sugars. Physical activity recommendations from recent expert reports were endorsed. The overall quality of the American diet was assessed to identify overconsumed and underconsumed nutrients of public health concern. Common food characteristics of healthy dietary patterns were determined.

However, higher levels of alcohol consumption are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Indeed, behind only smoking and obesity, excessive alcohol consumption is the third leading cause of premature death in the United States. Heavy alcohol use (1) is one of the most common causes of reversible hypertension, (2) accounts for about one-third of all cases of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, (3) is a frequent cause of atrial fibrillation, and (4) markedly increases risks of stroke-both ischemic and hemorrhagic. The risk-to-benefit ratio of drinking appears higher in younger individuals, who also have higher rates of excessive or binge drinking and more frequently have adverse consequences of acute intoxication (for example, accidents, violence, and social strife). In fact, among males aged 15 to 59 years, alcohol abuse is the leading risk factor for premature death. Of the various drinking patterns, daily low- to moderate-dose alcohol intake, ideally red wine before or during the evening meal, is associated with the strongest reduction in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Health care professionals should not recommend alcohol to nondrinkers because of the paucity of randomized outcome data and the potential for problem drinking even among individuals at apparently low risk.

To determine face validity, median total self-reported minutes per week of exercise as measured by the EVS were compared with findings from national population-based surveys. To determine discriminant validity, multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation were used to examine the ability of the EVS to discriminate between groups of patients with differing physical activity (PA) levels on the basis of demographics and health status. After 1.5 yr of implementation, 86% (1,537,798) of all eligible patients had an EVS in their electronic medical record. Overall, 36.3% of patients were completely inactive (0 min of exercise per week), 33.3% were insufficiently active (more than 0 but less than 150 min·wk), and 30.4% were sufficiently active (150 min or more per week).

Recent studies have suggested that using the current ACSM exercise preparticipation health screening guidelines can result in excessive physician referrals, possibly creating a barrier to exercise participation. In addition, there is considerable evidence that exercise is safe for most people and has many associated health and fitness benefits; exercise-related cardiovascular events are often preceded by warning signs/symptoms; and the cardiovascular risks associated with exercise lessen as individuals become more physically active/fit. Consequently, a scientific roundtable was convened by the ACSM in June 2014 to evaluate the current exercise preparticipation health screening recommendations. The roundtable proposed a new evidence-informed model for exercise preparticipation health screening on the basis of three factors: 1) the individual's current level of physical activity, 2) presence of signs or symptoms and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease, and 3) desired exercise intensity, as these variables have been identified as risk modulators of exercise-related cardiovascular events. Identifying cardiovascular disease risk factors remains an important objective of overall disease prevention and management, but risk factor profiling is no longer included in the exercise preparticipation health screening process.

To explore the potential use of zebrafish as a preclinical model to predict cardiotoxicity and to determine whether sorafenib has associated cardiotoxicity, and, if so, define the mechanisms. We find that the zebrafish model is readily able to discriminate a KI with little or no cardiotoxicity (gefitinib) from one with demonstrated cardiotoxicity (sunitinib). Sorafenib, like sunitinib, leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis, a reduction in total myocyte number per heart, contractile dysfunction, and ventricular dilatation in zebrafish. In cultured rat cardiomyocytes, sorafenib induces cell death. This can be rescued by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of constitutively active MEK1, which restores ERK activity even in the presence of sorafenib. Whereas growth factor-induced activation of ERKs requires Raf, α-adrenergic agonist-induced activation of ERKs does not require it. Consequently, activation of α-adrenergic signaling markedly decreases sorafenib-induced cell death. Consistent with these in vitro data, inhibition of α-adrenergic signaling with the receptor antagonist prazosin worsens sorafenib-induced cardiomyopathy in zebrafish. Zebrafish may be a valuable preclinical tool to predict cardiotoxicity.

The dual cardioprotective and antitumor action of PI3Kγ inhibition was assessed in mouse mammary tumor models. PI3Kγ kinase-dead mice showed preserved cardiac function after chronic low-dose DOX treatment and were protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The beneficial effects of PI3Kγ inhibition were causally linked to enhanced autophagic disposal of DOX-damaged mitochondria. Consistently, either pharmacological or genetic blockade of autophagy in vivo abrogated the resistance of PI3Kγ kinase-dead mice to DOX cardiotoxicity. Mechanistically, PI3Kγ was triggered in DOX-treated hearts, downstream of Toll-like receptor 9, by the mitochondrial DNA released by injured organelles and contained in autolysosomes.
