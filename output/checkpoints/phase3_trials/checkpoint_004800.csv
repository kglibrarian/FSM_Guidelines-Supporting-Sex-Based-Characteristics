Using such a device, we validated the Omron HEM-907 blood pressure measuring device in hemodialysis patients. Twenty non-hypertensive subjects and 20 hemodialysis patients were studied. Six blood pressure readings were obtained in each participant; three readings were obtained using the automatic, oscillometric mode of Omron HEM-907 and three readings were obtained using the manual mode of the Omron HEM-907. In each situation, simultaneous digitized Korotkoff sounds and manometric pressures were recorded. The grading scale indicated by the British Hypertension Society protocol was used to assess the device. Systolic blood pressure measured simultaneously by digitized sound and pressures agreed closely for systolic pressure (Grade A for both hemodialysis and normal controls) but not for diastolic pressure (Grade C for both hemodialysis and controls). Sequential comparison of oscillometric readings with auscultated systolic and diastolic pressure yielded a Grade B for both hemodialysis patients and controls.

The ultrafiltration rates were divided into three categories: up to 10 ml/h/kg, 10-13 ml/h/kg, and over 13 ml/h/kg. Compared to ultrafiltration rates in the lowest group, rates in the highest were significantly associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.59 and 1.71, respectively. Overall, ultrafiltration rates between 10-13 ml/h/kg were not associated with all-cause or cardiovascular mortality; however, they were significantly associated among participants with congestive heart failure. Cubic spline interpolation suggested that the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality began to increase at ultrafiltration rates over 10 ml/h/kg regardless of the status of congestive heart failure.

Interventional studies for salt intake restriction have been efficient to reduce high blood pressure and decrease the interdialytic weight gain. In our unit, salt restriction is systematically prescribed to chronic kidney failure patients. We have evaluated from food recall or 3-day questionnaires the salt intake in 91 hemodialysis patients during the year 2005. Daily salt intake, not including salt added during cooking, was found at 3.8 g/day. This intake is correlated to interdialytic weight gain, water and phosphate intakes, and to BMI.

We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science up to August 22, 2019. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), both parallel and cross-over, of low (<138 mM) versus neutral (138-140 mM) or high (>140 mM) dialysate [Na+] for maintenance HD patients were included. Mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values were estimated to compare the outcomes. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality independently. All statistical analyses were performed using the standard statistical procedures of RevMan 5.2. 12 Randomised controlled trials with 390 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Of these studies, three studies were parallel group, and the remaining nine were crossover.

It aims to provide guidance on how to look after patients and how to run dialysis units, and provides standards which units should in general aim to achieve. We would not advise patients to interpret the guideline as a rulebook, but perhaps to answer the question: ""what does good quality haemodialysis look like?""The guideline is split into sections: each begins with a few statements which are graded by strength (1 is a firm recommendation, 2 is more like a sensible suggestion), and the type of research available to back up the statement, ranging from A (good quality trials so we are pretty sure this is right) to D (more like the opinion of experts than known for sure). After the statements there is a short summary explaining why we think this, often including a discussion of some of the most helpful research. There is then a list of the most important medical articles so that you can read further if you want to - most of this is freely available online, at least in summary form.A few notes on the individual sections: 1. This section is about how much dialysis a patient should have. The effectiveness of dialysis varies between patients because of differences in body size and age etc., so different people need different amounts, and this section gives guidance on what defines ""enough"" dialysis and how to make sure each person is getting that. Quite a bit of this section is very technical, for example, the term ""eKt/V"" is often used: this is a calculation based on blood tests before and after dialysis, which measures the effectiveness of a single dialysis session in a particular patient. 2. This section deals with ""non-standard"" dialysis, which basically means anything other than 3 times per week. For example, a few people need 4 or more sessions per week to keep healthy, and some people are fine with only 2 sessions per week - this is usually people who are older, or those who have only just started dialysis. Special considerations for children and pregnant patients are also covered here. 3. This section deals with membranes (the type of ""filter"" used in the dialysis machine) and ""HDF"" (haemodiafiltration) which is a more complex kind of dialysis which some doctors think is better. Studies are still being done, but at the moment we think it's as good as but not better than regular dialysis. 4. This section deals with fluid removal during dialysis sessions: how to remove enough fluid without causing cramps and low blood pressure. Amongst other recommendations we advise close collaboration with patients over this. 5. This section deals with dialysate, which is the fluid used to ""pull"" toxins out of the blood (it is sometimes called the ""bath""). The level of things like potassium in the dialysate is important, otherwise too much or too little may be removed. There is a section on dialysate buffer (bicarbonate) and also a section on phosphate, which occasionally needs to be added into the dialysate. 6. This section is about anticoagulation (blood thinning) which is needed to stop the circuit from clotting, but sometimes causes side effects. 7. This section is about certain safety aspects of dialysis, not seeking to replace well-established local protocols, but focussing on just a few where we thought some national-level guidance would be useful. 8. This section draws together a few aspects of dialysis which don't easily fit elsewhere, and which impact on how dialysis feels to patients, rather than the medical outcome, though of course these are linked. This is where home haemodialysis and exercise are covered. There is an appendix at the end which covers a few aspects in more detail, especially the mathematical ideas. Several aspects of dialysis are not included in this guideline since they are covered elsewhere, often because they are aspects which affect non-dialysis patients too. This includes: anaemia, calcium and bone health, high blood pressure, nutrition, infection control, vascular access, transplant planning, and when dialysis should be started.",success

Whilst there is increasing evidence about the beneficial effects of exercise interventions on quality of life, functional capacity, aerobic fitness, and muscular strength, there are few compelling data on the effects of such programs on cardiovascular outcome measures.

25877881,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Hypertension is almost universal in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and contributes to the substantial cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality observed in these patients. The management of blood pressure (BP) in ESRD is complicated by a number of factors, including missed dialysis treatments, intradialytic changes in BP, medication removal with dialysis, and poor correlation of BPs obtained in the dialysis unit with those at home and with CV outcomes. Control of extracellular volume with ultrafiltration and dietary sodium restriction represents the principal strategy to manage hypertension in ESRD, and antihypertensive medications are subsequently added if this strategy is inadequate. While reduction in BP with medication improves CV outcomes, few head-to-head clinical trials have been performed to firmly establish the superiority of one antihypertensive medication class over another. Therefore, individualization of therapy is necessary, and patient comorbidities must be considered. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta-blockers are reasonable first-line agents for most patients. ACE inhibitors and ARBs exert cardioprotective effects that are independent of BP reduction. Medications that are removed with dialysis may be preferred in patients who are prone to develop intradialytic hypotension. Intradialytic hypertension can be managed with challenging the patient's dry weight and using nondialyzable medications. Within a class of antihypertensive medications, there may be large variability in drug removal with dialysis, which must be considered upon medication selection. Studies demonstrate that even thrice-weekly dosing of medication after dialysis has robust BP-lowering effects, which may be a useful regimen in nonadherent patients.",success

Subjects were randomly assigned to either open-label lisinopril (n = 100) or atenolol (n = 100) each administered three times per week after dialysis. Monthly monitored home blood pressure (BP) was controlled to <140/90 mmHg with medications, dry weight adjustment and sodium restriction. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) from baseline to 12 months. At baseline, 44-h ambulatory BP was similar in the atenolol (151.5/87.1 mmHg) and lisinopril groups, and improved similarly over time in both groups. However, monthly measured home BP was consistently higher in the lisinopril group despite the need for both a greater number of antihypertensive agents and a greater reduction in dry weight. An independent data safety monitoring board recommended termination because of cardiovascular safety. Serious cardiovascular events in the atenolol group occurred in 16 subjects, who had 20 events, and in the lisinopril group in 28 subjects, who had 43 events {incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.36 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.36-4.23, P = 0.001]}. Combined serious adverse events of myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death in the atenolol group occurred in 10 subjects, who had 11 events and in the lisinopril group in 17 subjects, who had 23 events (IRR 2.29, P = 0.021). Hospitalizations for heart failure were worse in the lisinopril group (IRR 3.13, P = 0.021). All-cause hospitalizations were higher in the lisinopril group [IRR 1.61 (95% CI 1.18-2.19, P = 0.002)]. LVMI improved with time; no difference between drugs was noted. Among maintenance dialysis patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, atenolol-based antihypertensive therapy may be superior to lisinopril-based therapy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause hospitalizations.

Several lines of evidence support the concept that therapy with beta-blocking agents reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (HF), but the demonstration of such a survival benefit in dialysis patients with dilated cardiomyopathy is still lacking. A total of 114 dialysis patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were randomized to receive either carvedilol or placebo in addition to standard therapy. A first analysis was performed at one year and was followed by an additional follow-up period of 12 months. Two-year echocardiographic data revealed a significant attenuation of pathologic remodeling, with smaller cavity diameters and higher ejection fractions in the active treatment group than in the placebo group. At two years, 51.7% of the patients died in the carvedilol group, compared with 73.2% in the placebo group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, there were significantly fewer cardiovascular deaths (29.3%) and hospital admissions (34.5%) among patients receiving carvedilol than among those receiving a placebo (67.9% and 58.9%, respectively; p < 0.00001). The exploratory analyses revealed that fatal myocardial infarctions, fatal strokes, and hospital admissions for worsening HF were lower in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group.

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared any type of CCB with other CCB, different doses of the same CCB, other antihypertensives, control or placebo were included. The minimum study duration was 12 weeks. Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). This review included 13 studies (24 reports) randomising 1459 participants treated with long-term haemodialysis. Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis (622 participants). No studies were performed in children or in those undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Overall, risk of bias was assessed as unclear to high across most domains. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in eight and one studies, respectively. Two studies reported low risk methods for blinding of participants and investigators, and outcome assessment was blinded in 10 studies. Three studies were at low risk of attrition bias, eight studies were at low risk of selective reporting bias, and five studies were at low risk of other potential sources of bias. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low for all outcomes. No events were reported for cardiovascular death in any of the comparisons.

Intradialytic hypotension was not reported. The benefits of CCBs over other antihypertensives on predialysis blood pressure levels and intradialytic hypotension among people with CKD who required haemodialysis were uncertain. Effects of CCBs on other side effects and cardiovascular death also remain uncertain. Dihydropyridine CCBs may decrease predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure level compared to placebo or no treatment. No studies were identified in children or peritoneal dialysis. Available studies have not been designed to measure the effects on costs. The shortcomings of the studies were that they recruited very few participants, had few events, had very short follow-up periods, some outcomes were not reported, and the reporting of outcomes such as changes in blood pressure was not done uniformly across studies.

Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central to September 2017. We included retrospective and prospective observational studies, and randomised controlled trials. The population of interest included patients hospitalised for medical (i.e. non-surgical) illness who developed newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Studies were included if they included data on either the incidence of atrial fibrillation or the rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence in atrial fibrillation occurring transiently with stress patients following hospital discharge. Two reviewers collected data independently and in duplicate. We characterised each study's methodology for ascertainment of prior atrial fibrillation history, atrial fibrillation during hospitalisation and atrial fibrillation recurrence after hospital discharge. Thirty-six studies reported the incidence of atrial fibrillation. Ten used a prospective design and included a period of continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Atrial fibrillation incidence ranged from 1% to 44%, which was too heterogeneous to justify meta-analysis ( I<sup>2</sup>=99%). In post-hoc meta-regression models, the use of continuous ECG monitoring explained 13% of the variance in atrial fibrillation incidence, while care in an intensive care unit explained none. Two studies reported the long-term rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence following atrial fibrillation occurring transiently with stress. Neither of these studies used prospective, systematic monitoring. Recurrence rates at 5 years ranged from 42% to 68%. The incidence of atrial fibrillation with medical illness may be as high as 44%, with higher estimates in reports using continuous ECG monitoring. Within 5 years following hospital discharge, atrial fibrillation recurrence is documented in approximately half of patients; however, the true rate may be higher. PROSPERO CRD42016043240.",success
29627355,False,"Journal Article;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural;Review",,,,,,,,True,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in the ICU. Preexisting AF is highly prevalent among older patients with chronic conditions who are at risk for critical illness, whereas new-onset AF can be triggered by accelerated atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenic triggers encountered during critical illness. The acute loss of atrial systole and onset of rapid ventricular rates that characterize new-onset AF often lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise. Thus, new-onset AF is both a marker of disease severity as well as a likely contributor to poor outcomes, similar to other manifestations of organ dysfunction during critical illness. Evaluating immediate hemodynamic effects of new-onset AF during critical illness is an important component of rapid clinical assessment aimed at identifying patients in need of urgent direct current cardioversion, treatment of reversible inciting factors, and identification of patients who may benefit from pharmacologic rate or rhythm control. In addition to acute hemodynamic effects, new-onset AF during critical illness is associated with both short- and long-term increases in the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death, with AF recurrence rates of approximately 50% within 1 year following hospital discharge. In the absence of a strong evidence base, there is substantial practice variation in the choice of strategies for management of new-onset AF during critical illness. We describe acute and long-term evaluation and management strategies based on current evidence and propose future avenues of investigation to fill large knowledge gaps in the management of patients with AF during critical illness.",success
33739130,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Background Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is common after cardiac surgery, but little is known about its incidence and natural course after noncardiac surgery. We evaluated the natural course and clinical impact of POAF and the long-term impact of anticoagulation therapy in patients without a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing noncardiac surgery. Methods and Results We retrospectively analyzed the database of Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) to identify patients who developed new-onset POAF after undergoing noncardiac surgery between January 2006 and January 2016. The main outcomes were AF recurrence, thromboembolic event, and major bleeding during follow-up. Of 322 688 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery, 315 patients (mean age, 66.4 years; 64.4% male) had new-onset POAF with regular rhythm monitoring after discharge. AF recurred in 53 (16.8%) during 2 years of follow-up. Hypertension (hazard ratio, 2.12; <i>P</i>=0.02), moderate-to-severe left atrial enlargement (hazard ratio, 2.33; <i>P</i>=0.007) were independently associated with recurrence. Patients with recurrent AF had higher risks of thromboembolic events (11.2% versus 0.8%; <i>P</i><0.001) and major bleeding (26.9% versus 4.1%; <i>P</i><0.001) than those without recurrence. Patients with recurrent AF and without anticoagulation were especially predisposed to thromboembolic events (<i>P</i><0.001). Overall, anticoagulation therapy was not significantly associated with thromboembolic events (1.4% versus 2.5%, <i>P</i>=0.95). Conclusions AF recurred in 16.8% of patients with POAF after noncardiac surgery. AF recurrence was associated with higher risks of adverse clinical outcomes. Considering the high risk of anticoagulation-related bleeding, the benefits of routine anticoagulation should be carefully weighed in this population. Active surveillance for AF recurrence is warranted.",success

Using Danish nationwide registries, the authors identified all patients who developed POAF following noncardiac surgery from 1996 to 2015. These were matched by age, sex, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, previous thromboembolism, ischemic heart disease, and year of diagnosis to patients with nonsurgical NVAF in a 1:4 ratio. Comparative long-term risk of thromboembolism was examined by multivariable Cox regression models. In patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, 6,048 (0.4%) developed POAF during hospitalization, with the highest incidences following thoracic/pulmonary, vascular, and abdominal surgery. A total of 3,830 patients with POAF were matched with 15,320 patients with NVAF.

From a multi-institutional longitudinal electronic medical record database, we identified patients with newly diagnosed AF between 2000 and 2014. We developed algorithms to identify acute AF precipitants (surgery, sepsis, pneumonia, pneumothorax, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, thyrotoxicosis, alcohol, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, and myocarditis). We assessed risks of AF recurrence in individuals with and without a precipitant and the relations between AF recurrence and heart failure, stroke, and mortality. Among 10 723 patients with newly diagnosed AF (67.9±9.9 years, 41% women), 19% had an acute AF precipitant, the most common of which were cardiac surgery (22%), pneumonia (20%), and noncardiothoracic surgery (15%).

Long-term data on new POAF recurrence and anticoagulation remain sparse. This is a single-center, prospective observational study evaluating 42 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and diagnosed during indexed admission with new-onset, transient, POAF between May 2015 and December 2019.

Subsequently, for development of a risk score estimating the probability of a first occurrence of atrial fibrillation within the following 24 hours, we performed logistic regression analysis. Among 1,782 patients with sepsis admitted to two tertiary intensive care units in the Netherlands between January 2011 and June 2013, a total of 1,087 episodes of atrial fibrillation occurred in 418 (23%) individuals.

MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web Of Science were searched for studies reporting the incidence of new-onset AF, atrial flutter or supraventricular tachycardia in patients with sepsis admitted to an intensive care unit, excluding studies that primarily focused on postcardiotomy patients. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the GRADE system. Risk factors were considered to have a high level of evidence if they were reported in ≥ 2 studies using multivariable analyses at a P value <0.05. Subsequently, the strength of association was classified as strong, moderate or weak, based on the reported odds ratios. Eleven studies were included. Overall quality was low to moderate. The weighted mean incidence of new-onset AF was 8% (range 0 to 14%), 10% (4 to 23%) and 23% (6 to 46%) in critically ill patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, respectively. Independent risk factors with a high level of evidence included advanced age (weak strength of association), white race (moderate association), presence of a respiratory tract infection (weak association), organ failure (moderate association), and pulmonary artery catheter use (moderate association). Protective factors were a history of diabetes mellitus (weak association) and the presence of a urinary tract infection (weak association). New-onset AF was associated with increased short-term mortality in five studies (crude relative effect estimates ranging from 1.96 to 3.32; adjusted effects 1.07 to 3.28). Three studies reported a significantly increased length of stay in the ICU (weighted mean difference 9 days, range 5 to 13 days), whereas an increased risk of ischemic stroke was reported in the single study that looked at this outcome.

New-onset atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiovascular instability and thromboembolism, and has been independently associated with increased length of hospital stay and mortality. The long-term consequences are unclear. Current practice guidance is based on patients outside the intensive care unit; however, new-onset atrial fibrillation that develops while in an intensive care unit differs in its causes and the risks and clinical effectiveness of treatments. The lack of evidence on new-onset atrial fibrillation treatment or long-term outcomes in intensive care units means that practice varies. Identifying optimal treatment strategies and defining long-term outcomes are critical to improving care. In patients treated in an intensive care unit, the objectives were to (1) evaluate existing evidence for the clinical effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological new-onset atrial fibrillation treatments, (2) compare the use and clinical effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological new-onset atrial fibrillation treatments, and (3) determine outcomes associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation. We undertook a scoping review that included studies of interventions for treatment or prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation involving adults in general intensive care units. To investigate the long-term outcomes associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation, we carried out a retrospective cohort study using English national intensive care audit data linked to national hospital episode and outcome data. To analyse the clinical effectiveness of different new-onset atrial fibrillation treatments, we undertook a retrospective cohort study of two large intensive care unit databases in the USA and the UK. Existing evidence was generally of low quality, with limited data suggesting that beta-blockers might be more effective than amiodarone for converting new-onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and for reducing mortality. Using linked audit data, we showed that patients developing new-onset atrial fibrillation have more comorbidities than those who do not. After controlling for these differences, patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation had substantially higher mortality in hospital and during the first 90 days after discharge (adjusted odds ratio 2.32, 95% confidence interval 2.16 to 2.48; adjusted hazard ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.70, respectively), and higher rates of subsequent hospitalisation with atrial fibrillation, stroke and heart failure (adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio 5.86, 95% confidence interval 5.33 to 6.44; adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.93; and adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.44, respectively), than patients who did not have new-onset atrial fibrillation. From intensive care unit data, we found that new-onset atrial fibrillation occurred in 952 out of 8367 (11.4%) UK and 1065 out of 18,559 (5.7%) US intensive care unit patients in our study. The median time to onset of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients who received treatment was 40 hours, with a median duration of 14.4 hours. The clinical characteristics of patients developing new-onset atrial fibrillation were similar in both databases. New-onset atrial fibrillation was associated with significant average reductions in systolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg, despite significant increases in vasoactive medication (vasoactive-inotropic score increase of 2.3; <i>p</i> < 0.001). After adjustment, intravenous beta-blockers were not more effective than amiodarone in achieving rate control (adjusted hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.44) or rhythm control (adjusted hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.11). Digoxin therapy was associated with a lower probability of achieving rate control (adjusted hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.86) and calcium channel blocker therapy was associated with a lower probability of achieving rhythm control (adjusted hazard ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.79) than amiodarone. Findings were consistent across both the combined and the individual database analyses. Existing evidence for new-onset atrial fibrillation management in intensive care unit patients is limited. New-onset atrial fibrillation in these patients is common and is associated with significant short- and long-term complications. Beta-blockers and amiodarone appear to be similarly effective in achieving cardiovascular control, but digoxin and calcium channel blockers appear to be inferior. Our findings suggest that a randomised controlled trial of amiodarone and beta-blockers for management of new-onset atrial fibrillation in critically ill patients should be undertaken. Studies should also be undertaken to provide evidence for or against anticoagulation for patients who develop new-onset atrial fibrillation in intensive care units. Finally, given that readmission with heart failure and thromboembolism increases following an episode of new-onset atrial fibrillation while in an intensive care unit, a prospective cohort study to demonstrate the incidence of atrial fibrillation and/or left ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge and at 3 months following the development of new-onset atrial fibrillation should be undertaken.

Over a 12-month period ending July 31, 1994, a CABG procedure was performed on 570 consecutive patients (age range, 32 to 87 years; median age, 67 years; 232 [41%] were > or = 70 years; 175 [31%] were women; 173 [30%] were diabetics; 364 [65%] required nonelective surgery; 86 [15%] had had a prior CABG; and 86 [15%] had had prior percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty). AF occurred in 189 patients (33%). The median age for patients with AF was 71 years compared with 66 for patients without (P = .0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, +/- 95% CI, P value) was used to identify the following independent predictors of postoperative AF: increasing age (age 70 to 80 years [OR = 2; CI, 1.3 to 3; P = .002], age > 80 years [OR = 3; CI, 1.6 to 5.8; P = .0007]), male gender (OR = 1.7; CI, 1.1 to 2.7; P = .01), hypertension (OR = 1.6; CI, 1.0 to 2.3; P = .03), need for an intraoperative intraaortic balloon pump (OR = 3.5; CI, 1.2 to 10.9; P = .03), postoperative pneumonia (OR = 3.9; CI, 1.3 to 11.5; P = .01), ventilation for > 24 hours (OR = 2; CI, 1.3 to 3.2; P = .003), and return to the intensive care unit (OR = 3.2; CI, 1.1 to 8.8; P = .03). The mean length of hospital stay after surgery was 15.3 +/- 28.6 days for patients with AF compared with 9.3 +/- 19.6 days for patients without AF (P = .001). The adjusted length of hospital stay attributable to AF was 4.9 days, corresponding to > or = $10 055 in hospital charges. AF remains the most common complication after CABG and consequently is a drain on hospital resources. Concerted efforts to reduce the incidence of AF and the associated increased length of stay would result in substantial cost saving and decrease patient morbidity.",success

Nevertheless, there is considerable debate as to whether this reflects an independent association of POAF with poorer outcomes or confounding by other factors. We sought to investigate this issue. Data obtained from June 2001 through December 2009 by the Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Surgery Database Program were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic and operative data were compared between patients who developed POAF and those who did not using chi-square and t tests. The independent impact of POAF on 14 short-term complications and long-term mortality was determined using binary logistic and Cox regression, respectively. Excluding patients with preoperative arrhythmia, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery was performed in 19,497 patients. Of these, 5,547 (28.5%) developed POAF. Patients with POAF were generally older (mean age 69 vs 65 years, p <0.001) and presented more often with co-morbidities including congestive heart failure (p <0.001), hypertension (p <0.001), cerebrovascular disease (p <0.001), and renal failure (p = 0.046). Patients with POAF demonstrated a greater 30-day mortality on univariate analysis but not on multivariate analysis (p = 0.376). Patients with POAF were, however, at an independently increased risk of perioperative complications including permanent stroke (p <0.001), new renal failure (p <0.001), infective complications (p <0.001), gastrointestinal complications (p <0.001), and return to the theater (p <0.001). POAF was also independently associated with shorter long-term survival (p = 0.002). In conclusion, POAF is a risk factor for short-term morbidity and decreased long-term survival. Rigorous evaluation of various therapies that prevent or decrease the impact of POAF is imperative.

Associated adverse consequences of POAF include haemodynamic instability, increased risk of stroke, lengthened hospital and intensive care unit stays and greater costs. Underlying mechanisms are incompletely defined but include intraoperative and postoperative phenomena, such as inflammation, sympathetic activation and cardiac ischaemia, that combine to trigger atrial fibrillation, often in the presence of pre-existing factors, making the atria vulnerable to atrial fibrillation induction and maintenance. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms might enable the identification of new therapeutic targets. POAF can be prevented by targeting autonomic alterations and inflammation. β-Blocker prophylaxis is the best-established preventive therapy and should be started or continued before cardiac surgery, unless contraindicated.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between PFV and new-onset AF following coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). PFV was measured using computed tomography in 83 patients with coronary artery disease scheduled to undergo elective isolated on-pump CABG. Patient characteristics, medical history and perioperative variables were prospectively collected. Any documented episode of new-onset postoperative AF until discharge was defined as the study end point. Twenty-eight patients (33.7%) developed postoperatively AF during hospital stay. There was no significant difference in demographics and comorbidities among patients that maintained sinus rhythm (SR) and their AF counterparts. In univariate analysis, patients with postoperative AF had significantly more pericardial fat compared with SR patients (195 ± 80 ml vs 126 ± 47 ml, P = 0.0001). Larger left atrial diameter was also associated with postoperative AF (42.4 ± 6.9 mm vs 39.3 ± 4.8 mm, P = 0.017). Additionally, the prebypass use of calcium channel-blocking agents was independently associated with a lower incidence of postoperative AF, confirmed also by multivariate analysis (P = 0.035).

Biomolecular and clinical articles focused on assessing the contribution of pericardial blood, or the resulting inflammation within the pericardial space and its potential role in triggering POAF, were included in this review. Evidence suggests that shed mediastinal blood through breakdown products, activation of coagulation cascade, and oxidative burst contributes to a highly pro-oxidant and proinflammatory milieu found within the pericardial space that can trigger postoperative atrial fibrillation in susceptible persons. The extent of this reaction could be blunted by reducing the exposition of pericardium to blood either through posterior pericardiotomy or improved chest drainage. Shed mediastinal blood undergoing transformation within the pericardium appears to be an important contributing factor to POAF.

Perhaps less familiar to clinicians is the fact that drugs can also trigger other arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome. Some drug-induced arrhythmias (bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia) are significant predominantly because of their symptoms; others (monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome, torsades de pointes) may result in serious consequences, including sudden cardiac death. Mechanisms of arrhythmias are well known for some medications but, in other instances, remain poorly understood. For some drug-induced arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, risk factors are well defined. Modification of risk factors, when possible, is important for prevention and risk reduction. In patients with nonmodifiable risk factors who require a potentially arrhythmia-inducing drug, enhanced electrocardiographic and other monitoring strategies may be beneficial for early detection and treatment. Management of drug-induced arrhythmias includes discontinuation of the offending medication and following treatment guidelines for the specific arrhythmia. In overdose situations, targeted detoxification strategies may be needed.

The CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were significant predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation in separate multivariate regression analyses. The Kaplan-Meier analysis obtained a higher postoperative atrial fibrillation rate when based on the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores of at least 2 than when based on scores less than 2 (both log rank, P < .001). In addition, the CHA2DS2-VASc scores could be used to further stratify the patients with CHADS2 scores of 0 or 1 into 2 groups with different postoperative atrial fibrillation rates at a cutoff value of 2 (12% vs 32%; P = .01).

The present study evaluated the utility of this scoring system in predicting the risk of developing de novo POAF in cardiac surgery patients. A total of 2385 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at our institution from 2008-2014 were identified for analysis. Each patient was assigned a CHA2DS2-VASc score and placed into a low- (score of 0), intermediate- (1), or high-risk (≥2) group. A multivariate regression model was created to control for known risk factors of atrial fibrillation. POAF occurred in 380 of 2385 patients (15.9%). Mean CHA2DS2-VASc scores among patients with POAF and without POAF were 3.6 ± 1.7 and 2.8 ± 1.7, respectively (P < 0.0001). Using multivariate analysis, as a patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score rose from 0-9, the risk of developing POAF increased from 8.2%-42.3%.

One hundred eighty-seven patients with no history of atrial arrhythmia who had a preoperative BNP level and had undergone cardiac surgery were identified. Their records were reviewed, and postoperative ECG and telemetry strips were analyzed for AF until the time of discharge. Postop AF was documented in 80 patients (42.8%). AF patients were older (68+/-11 versus 64+/-14 years, P=0.04), but there was no difference in sex distribution, hypertension, left ventricular (LV) function, LV hypertrophy (LVH), left atrial size, history of coronary artery disease (CAD), or beta-blocker use. Preop plasma BNP levels were higher in the postop AF patients (615 versus 444 pg/mL, P=0.005). After adjustment for age, sex, type of surgery, hypertension, LV function, LVH, left atrial size, CAD, and beta-blocker use, the odds ratios of postop AF according to increasing quartiles, compared with patients with lowest quartile, were 1.8, 2.5, and 3.7 (P(trend)=0.03).

There is increasing evidence that most patients with recent-onset AF or atrial flutter (AFL) can be safely managed in the emergency department (ED) without the need for hospital admission. The priorities for ED management of recent-onset AF/AFL include rapid assessment of potential hemodynamic instability and identification and treatment of the underlying or precipitating cause. A careful evaluation of the patient's history should be performed to determine the time of onset of the arrhythmia. All patients should be stratified using a predictive index for the risk of stroke (eg, CHADS(2)). For stable patients with recent-onset AF/AFL, a strategy of either rate control or rhythm control could be selected based on multiple factors including the duration of AF and the severity of symptoms. If a strategy of rhythm control has been selected, either electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion may be used. Before proceeding to cardioversion in the absence of systemic anticoagulation, physicians must be confident that the duration of AF/AFL is clearly <48 hours and that the patient is not at a particularly high risk of stroke. When the duration of AF/AFL is >48 hours or uncertain, rate control should be optimized first and the patients should receive therapeutic anticoagulation for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after planned cardioversion. Adequate follow-up of patients with recent-onset AF/AFL is recommended to identify structural heart disease and evaluate the need for long-term antithrombotic or antiarrhythmic therapy.",success

All patients were followed for 2 months. There were large variations concerning mode of CV used, ECV being heterogeneous. A choice of PCV drug depended on the clinical patient profile. Sinus rhythm was restored in 89.7% of patients by ECV and in 69.1% after PCV. Among patients not undergoing CV during admission, 34% spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm within 24h. ECV was most successful in patients pretreated with antiarrhythmic drugs (mostly amiodarone). PCV was enhanced by class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs; conversion rate on amiodarone was similar to that seen with rate control drugs. Female patients and those with paroxysmal and first detected AF as well as those without previous ECV responded well to PCV. The median duration of hospital stay was 16.2 and 24.0 h for ECV and PCV patients, respectively. There were very few CV-related complications regardless of mode of CV. Chronic maintenance of sinus rhythm was enhanced in patients on chronic antiarrhythmic drugs, beta-blockers or inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Mode of CV varied significantly, but both PCV and ECV were safe and effective.

Our primary aim was to compare conversion to sinus rhythm between pharmacological cardioversion followed by electrical cardioversion (drug-shock), and electrical cardioversion alone (shock-only). Our secondary aim was to compare the effectiveness of two pad positions for electrical cardioversion. We did a partial factorial trial of two protocols for patients with acute atrial fibrillation at 11 academic hospital emergency departments in Canada. We enrolled adult patients with acute atrial fibrillation. Protocol 1 was a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled comparison of attempted pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous procainamide (15 mg/kg over 30 min) followed by electrical cardioversion if necessary (up to three shocks, each of ≥200 J), and placebo infusion followed by electrical cardioversion. For patients having electrical cardioversion, we used Protocol 2, a randomised, open-label, nested comparison of anteroposterior versus anterolateral pad positions. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by study site) for Protocol 1 by on-site research personnel using an online electronic data capture system. Randomisation for Protocol 2 occurred 30 min after drug infusion for patients who had not converted and was stratified by site and Protocol 1 allocation. Patients and all research and emergency department staff were masked to treatment allocation for Protocol 1. The primary outcome was conversion to normal sinus rhythm for at least 30 min at any time after randomisation and up to a point immediately after three shocks. Protocol 1 was analysed by intention to treat and Protocol 2 excluded patients who did not receive electrical cardioversion. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891058. Between July 18, 2013, and Oct 17, 2018, we enrolled 396 patients, and none were lost to follow-up.

Both the drug-shock and shock-only strategies were highly effective, rapid, and safe in restoring sinus rhythm for patients in the emergency department with acute atrial fibrillation, avoiding the need for return to hospital. The drug infusion worked for about half of patients and avoided the resource intensive procedural sedation required for electrical cardioversion.

8903275,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"The clinical utility of ibutilide fumarate (Corvert) for the acute conversion of atrial tachyarrhythmias to normal sinus rhythm has been demonstrated in several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The efficacy of intravenous ibutilide for rapid conversion of atrial flutter is in the range of 50-70%, whereas its efficacy for conversion of atrial fibrillation is 30-50%. Approximately 80% of atrial tachyarrhythmias that terminate do so within 30 minutes from the initiation of the intravenous infusion. Ibutilide is more effective than either intravenous procainamide or intravenous sotalol for conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to sinus rhythm. Age, presence of structural heart disease, gender and concomitant medication do not appear to influence the efficacy of ibutilide; however, shorter duration of atrial fibrillation is a strong predictor of successful termination. Plasma concentration of ibutilide and QTc interval prolongation are not directly correlated with the success rate for conversion of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Ibutilide's greater efficacy compared with other antiarrhythmic drugs may be related to its ability to cause greater prolongation of atrial monophasic action potential duration relative to atrial cycle length. Termination of atrial flutter with ibutilide was preceded by increased atrial cycle length variability. Ibutilide rapidly and effectively converts atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to sinus rhythm when administered as a 1-mg total dose followed by a second 1-mg dose. It should be used in conjunction with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for at least 4 hours after the termination of the infusion, or until the QTc interval returns to baseline. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should be corrected before the start of the infusion. An external cardiac defibrillator, intravenous magnesium, and an external transcutaneous cardiac pacemaker should be readily available for immediate use in the event that palymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias occur.

The oral propafenone regimen was as efficacious as the single dose oral loading regimen of flecainide but was superior to those of quinidine and amiodarone. The adverse effects reported were transient arrhythmia, reversible QRS-complex widening, transient hypotension and mild noncardiac side effects. The transient arrhythmias were chiefly at the time of conversion and included appearance of atrial flutter, bradycardia, pauses and junctional rhythm.

The key event underlying this life-threatening complication is the overwhelming inflammatory host response to the pathogen leading to the overexpression of inflammatory mediators. The latter, along with the microorganism and its derivatives drive the major changes responsible for massive thrombin formation and fibrin deposition: (1) aberrant expression of tissue factor mainly by monocytes-macrophages, (2) impairment of anticoagulant pathways, orchestrated by dysfunctional endothelial cells (ECs), and (3) suppression of fibrinolysis because of the overproduction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 by ECs and thrombin-mediated activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. Neutrophils and other cells, upon activation or death, release nuclear materials (neutrophil extracellular traps and/or their components such as histones, DNA, lysosomal enzymes, and High Mobility Group Box-1), which have toxic, proinflammatory and prothrombotic properties thus contributing to clotting dysregulation.

Formation of denser fibrin meshworks, relatively resistant to plasmin-mediated lysis has been demonstrated in patients with AF. The presence of stroke risk factors in AF, such as diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, or stroke, advanced age have been shown to be linked to the prothrombotic clot characteristics, including reduced clot permeability and lysability. Importantly, biomarkers, including cardiac troponins and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, are associated with thrombin generation and fibrin-related markers in AF patients.

To determine if the burden of atrial fibrillation characterized using noninvasive, continuous ambulatory monitoring is associated with the risk of ischemic stroke or arterial thromboembolism in adults with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This retrospective cohort study conducted from October 2011 and October 2016 at 2 large integrated health care delivery systems used an extended continuous cardiac monitoring system to identify adults who were found to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on 14-day continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. The burden of atrial fibrillation was defined as the percentage of analyzable wear time in atrial fibrillation or flutter during the up to 14-day monitoring period. Ischemic stroke and other arterial thromboembolic events occurring while patients were not taking anticoagulation were identified through November 2016 using electronic medical records and were validated by manual review. We evaluated the association of the burden of atrial fibrillation with thromboembolism while not taking anticoagulation after adjusting for the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) or CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk scores.

Many studies examine outcomes by AF burden classified by AF type (paroxysmal versus nonparoxysmal); however, quantitatively, AF burden can be defined by longest duration, number of AF episodes during a monitoring period, and the proportion of time an individual is in AF during a monitoring period (expressed as a percentage). Current guidelines make identical recommendations for anticoagulation regardless of AF pattern or burden; however, a review of recent evidence suggests that higher AF burden is associated with higher risk of stroke. It is unclear whether the risk increases continuously or whether a threshold exists; if a threshold exists, it has not been defined. Higher burden of AF is also associated with higher prevalence and incidence of heart failure and higher risk of mortality, but not necessarily lower quality of life. A structured and comprehensive risk factor management program targeting risk factors, weight loss, and maintenance of a healthy weight appears to be effective in reducing AF burden. Despite this growing understanding of AF burden, research is needed into validation of definitions and measures of AF burden, determination of the threshold of AF burden that results in an increased risk of stroke that warrants anticoagulation, and discovery of the mechanisms underlying the weak temporal correlations of AF and stroke.

The C-statistic of the CHA2DS2VASc score was 0.72 (0.61 to 0.83) in predicting definite TEC in non-anticoagulated patients with first cardioversion. The incidence of definite TEC was significantly lower in 2,298 cardioversions performed during anticoagulation (0.1% vs 0.7%, p = 0.001), and the preventive effect of anticoagulation was significant in patients with a score of ≥2 (0.2% vs 1.1%, p = 0.001). In conclusion, CHA2DS2VASc score is a strong predictor of TEC in cardioversion of acute AF performed without anticoagulation. Importantly, periprocedural anticoagulation reduced the risk of TEC by 82%. The overall risk of these complications was low after failed cardioversion.",success

Patients with low stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc 0-1) did not suffer from any thromboembolic complications within 30days after cardioversion. After adjustment for factors included in CHA2DS2-VASc and after propensity score matching, patients without oral anticoagulation had higher risk for thromboembolic complications, odds ratio 2.54 (95% confidence interval 1.70-3.79) and odds ratio 2.51 (95% confidence interval 1.69-3.75).

We aimed to devise an optimal protocol for cardiac computed tomography (CCT) in diagnosing left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), using TEE as reference standard. Two hundred sixty consecutive patients referred for radiofrequency ablation for AF were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent CCT and TEE within 2 hours. The CCT protocol included one standard angiographic phase and three delayed acquisitions at 1-, 3-, and 6-min after contrast injection. Thrombi were defined as persisting defects at 6-min delayed acquisition. TEE demonstrated spontaneous contrast in 52 (20%) patients and thrombus in 10 (4%). In 63 patients (24%), CCT demonstrated LAA early filling defects at angiographic phase. Among them, 15 (6%) had a persistent defect at 1-min, 12 (5%) at 3-min, and 10 (4%) at 6-min. All 10 thrombi diagnosed on TEE were correctly identified by delayed CCT, without any false positives. For all phases, sensitivity and negative predictive were 100%. Specificity increased from 79% for the angiographic phase to 100% at 6-min. Positive predictive value increased from 16% to 100%. Estimated radiation exposure was 2.08 ± 0.76 mSv (mean ± standard deviation) for the angiographic phase and 0.45 ± 0.23 mSv for each delayed phase. A CCT protocol adding a 6-min delayed phase to the angiographic phase can be considered optimized for the diagnosis of LAA thrombi, with a low radiation dose. • In patients with persistent atrial fibrillation referred for ablation procedures, a cardiac CT examination comprising an angiographic-phase acquisition and, in case of filling defects, a 6-min delayed phase may help reduce the need for transesophageal echocardiography. • Cardiac CT would provide morphological and volumetric data, along with the potential to exclude the presence of thrombi in the left atrial appendage.",success

Open-label, randomized phase 2 study, conducted in a university hospital intensive care unit (ICU) between November 2010 and July 2012, involving patients in septic shock with a heart rate of 95/min or higher requiring high-dose norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or higher. We randomly assigned 77 patients to receive a continuous infusion of esmolol titrated to maintain heart rate between 80/min and 94/min for their ICU stay and 77 patients to standard treatment. Our primary outcome was a reduction in heart rate below the predefined threshold of 95/min and to maintain heart rate between 80/min and 94/min by esmolol treatment over a 96-hour period. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic and organ function measures; norepinephrine dosages at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours; and adverse events and mortality occurring within 28 days after randomization. Targeted heart rates were achieved in all patients in the esmolol group compared with those in the control group. The median AUC for heart rate during the first 96 hours was -28/min (IQR, -37 to -21) for the esmolol group vs -6/min (95% CI, -14 to 0) for the control group with a mean reduction of 18/min (P < .001). For stroke volume index, the median AUC for esmolol was 4 mL/m2 (IQR, -1 to 10) vs 1 mL/m2 for the control group (IQR, -3 to 5; P = .02), whereas the left ventricular stroke work index for esmolol was 3 mL/m2 (IQR, 0 to 8) vs 1 mL/m2 for the control group (IQR, -2 to 5; P = .03). For arterial lactatemia, median AUC for esmolol was -0.1 mmol/L (IQR, -0.6 to 0.2) vs 0.1 mmol/L for the control group (IQR, -0.3 for 0.6; P = .007); for norepinephrine, -0.11 μg/kg/min (IQR, -0.46 to 0.02) for the esmolol group vs -0.01 μg/kg/min (IQR, -0.2 to 0.44) for the control group (P = .003). Fluid requirements were reduced in the esmolol group: median AUC was 3975 mL/24 h (IQR, 3663 to 4200) vs 4425 mL/24 h(IQR, 4038 to 4775) for the control group (P < .001). We found no clinically relevant differences between groups in other cardiopulmonary variables nor in rescue therapy requirements.

23625756,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Activation of coagulation frequently occurs in severe infection and sepsis and may contribute to the development of thrombosis. Coagulation abnormalities in sepsis range from a small decrease in platelet count and subclinical prolongation of global clotting times to fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), characterized by simultaneous widespread microvascular thrombosis and profuse bleeding from various sites. Septic patients with severe forms of DIC may present with manifest thromboembolic disease or clinically less apparent microvascular fibrin deposition, which predominantly presents as multiple organ dysfunction. Thrombophilia is associated with a prohemostatic state and consequently with an increased tendency to develop thrombosis. Hypothetically, patients with thrombophilia may suffer from more severe coagulopathy in case of severe infection or sepsis, which may result in a more serious clinical course and an unfavorable outcome.

In this large cohort of patients with CIEDs and continuous rhythm monitoring prior to ischemic stroke, excess stroke risk above baseline was highest within 5 days of an episode of AF of 5.5 hours or more in duration and diminished rapidly thereafter. Our findings are consistent with the traditional view that AF is directly and transiently associated with ischemic stroke.

Pericardial effusion is common after cardiac surgery and can trigger atrial fibrillation. We tested the hypothesis that posterior left pericardiotomy, a surgical manoeuvre that drains the pericardial space into the left pleural cavity, might reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. In this adaptive, randomised, controlled trial, we recruited adult patients (aged ≥18 years) undergoing elective interventions on the coronary arteries, aortic valve, or ascending aorta, or a combination of these, performed by members of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery from Weill Cornell Medicine at the New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York, NY, USA. Patients were eligible if they had no history of atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias or contraindications to the experimental intervention. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1), stratified by CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score and using a mixed-block randomisation approach (block sizes of 4, 6, and 8), to posterior left pericardiotomy or no intervention. Patients and assessors were blinded to treatment assignment. Patients were followed up until 30 days after hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence of atrial fibrillation during postoperative in-hospital stay, which was assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02875405, and is now complete. Between Sept 18, 2017, and Aug 2, 2021, 3601 patients were screened and 420 were included and randomly assigned to the posterior left pericardiotomy group (n=212) or the no intervention group (n=208; ITT population). The median age was 61·0 years (IQR 53·0-70·0), 102 (24%) patients were female, and 318 (76%) were male, with a median CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 2·0 (IQR 1·0-3·0). The two groups were balanced with respect to clinical and surgical characteristics. No patients were lost to follow-up and data completeness was 100%. Three patients in the posterior left pericardiotomy group did not receive the intervention. In the ITT population, the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was significantly lower in the posterior left pericardiotomy group than in the no intervention group (37 [17%] of 212 vs 66 [32%] of 208 [p=0·0007]; odds ratio adjusted for the stratification variable 0·44 [95% CI 0·27-0·70; p=0·0005]). Two (1%) of 209 patients in the posterior left pericardiotomy group and one (<1%) of 211 in the no intervention group died within 30 days after hospital discharge. The incidence of postoperative pericardial effusion was lower in the posterior left pericardiotomy group than in the no intervention group (26 [12%] of 209 vs 45 [21%] of 211; relative risk 0·58 [95% CI 0·37-0·91]).

Electronic searches were performed using six databases from their inception to December 2013, identifying all relevant randomized trials and observational studies comparing BA vs. LA surgical ablation AF patients undertaking cardiac surgery. In 10 included studies, 2225 patient results were available for analysis to compare BA (n = 888) vs. LA (n = 1337) ablation. Sinus rhythm prevalence was higher in the BA cohort compared with the LA cohort at 6-month and 12-month follow-up, but similar beyond 1 year. Permanent pacemaker implantations were higher in the BA cohort, but 30-day and late mortality, neurological events, and reoperation for bleeding were similar between BA and LA groups. Biatrial and LA ablations produced comparable 30-day and late mortality but LA was associated with significantly reduced permanent pacemaker implantation rates. Biatrial ablation appeared to be more efficacious than LA ablation in achieving SR at 1 year, but this difference was not maintained beyond 1 year. Trends appear to be driven by the preferential selection of long-standing and persistent AF patients for the BA approach.

We analyzed 37 consecutive cases with atrial tachyarrhythmias after the Maze procedures and concomitant CSs between 2007 and 2019. Fifty-nine atrial tachyarrhythmias were induced in 37 consecutive cases, and 49 of those atrial tachyarrhythmias were mappable ATs. Forty ATs were related to the Maze procedures in the 49 mappable ATs (81.6%). All 37 consecutive cases had residual electrical conductions (gaps) in the Maze lines (88 gaps; 2.4 ± 1.2 gaps/patient). Forty of 88 gaps (45.5%) were associated with gap-related ATs. The common ATs in this study were 1. peri-mitral atrial flutter due to gaps at pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) line to mitral valve annulus (MVA) (20 cases), and 2. peri-tricuspid atrial flutter due to gaps at right atrial incision to the tricuspid valve annulus (TVA) (10 cases). Forty-seven of 49 ATs (95.9%) were successfully ablated at the first session, and there were no complications. The mean follow-up period after ablation was 3.6 ± 3.2 (median, 2.1; interquartile range, 0.89-6.84) years. The Kaplan-Meier analysis of freedom from recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias after Maze procedure was 82.7% at 1-year follow-up and 75.5% at 4-year follow-up after a single procedure. Reentry was the main mechanism of ATs after Maze procedures and concomitant CSs, and ATs were largely related to the gaps on the Maze lines between the PVI line and the MVA or those on the lines between right atrial incision to the TVA.

Flecainide (11 patients) was given as an intravenous bolus of 2 mg.kg-1 in 10 min and dofetilide (10 patients) as a maximum intravenous bolus of 8 micrograms.kg-1 in 15 min. Baseline characteristics were comparable between both groups. Only one patient treated with flecainide converted to sinus rhythm. This patient showed the largest flutter cycle length increase (280 to 420 ms). By contrast, seven of the 10 patients treated with dofetilide converted to sinus rhythm. Patients treated with flecainide showed a significantly larger increase in atrial flutter cycle length at the end of the infusion compared to the dofetilide-treated patients (from 226 +/- 28 to 317 +/- 52 ms vs from 221 +/- 26 to 239 +/- 39 ms, respectively). In conclusion, dofetilide is more effective than flecainide in the conversion of atrial flutter to sinus rhythm, despite the fact that flecainide produced a more prolonged flutter cycle length.

For RFA in AFL, 18 primary studies with 22 treatment arms and 1,323 patients were identified. Single-procedure success for AFL was 91.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88.4% to 94.9%). Multiple-procedure success was 97.0% (95% CI 94.7% to 99.4%). Postablation arrhythmia was noted in 13.2% of patients (95% CI 7.5% to 18.9%), while repeat ablation was reported in 8% (95% CI 4.5% to 11.4%). For RFA of SVT, 39 primary studies with 49 treatment arms in 7,693 patients with accessory pathways and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia were identified. Single-procedure success for SVT was 93.2% (95% CI 90.8% to 95.5%). Multiple-procedure success was 94.6% (95% CI 92.4% to 96.9). Postablation arrhythmia was noted in 5.6% patients (95% CI 4.1% to 7.2%). Repeat ablation occurred in 6.5% (95% CI 4.7% to 8.3%). For AFL studies, all-cause mortality was 0.6%, and adverse events were reported in 0.5% of patients. For SVT studies, all-cause mortality was 0.1%, and adverse events were reported in 2.9% of patients. In conclusion, studies of RFA for the treatment of patients with AFL and SVT report high efficacy rates and low rates of complications.",success

The analysis included 158 studies comprising 10 719 patients (79% men, 59.8+/-0.5 years old, 46% left atrial enlargement, 46% heart disease, 42% with history of atrial fibrillation, 14.3+/-0.4 months of follow-up). The overall acute success rate adjusted for reporting bias was 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5 to 92.4), 92.7% (95% CI, 90.0 to 94.8) for 8- to 10-mm tip/or irrigated radiofrequency catheters, and 87.9% (95% CI, 84.2 to 90.9) for 4- to 6-mm tip catheters (P>0.05). Atrial flutter recurrence rates were significantly reduced by use of 8- to 10-mm tip or irrigated radiofrequency catheters (6.7% versus 13.8%, P<0.05) and by use of bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block as a procedural end point (9.3% versus 23.6%, P<0.05). The AFL recurrence rate did not increase over time. The overall occurrence rate of atrial fibrillation after AFL ablation was 33.6% (95% CI, 29.7 to 37.3) but was 52.7% (95% CI, 47.8 to 57.6) in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation before ablation and 23.1% (95% CI, 17.5 to 29.9) in those without atrial fibrillation before ablation (P<0.05). The incidence of atrial fibrillation increased over time in both groups; however, 5 years after ablation, the incidence of atrial fibrillation was similar in those with and without atrial fibrillation before ablation. The acute complication rate was 2.6% (95% CI, 2 to 3). The mortality rate during follow-up was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.5). Antiarrhythmic drug use after ablation was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.6 to 37.8). The long-term use of coumadin was 65.9%, (95% CI, 43.8 to 82.8). Quality of life data were very limited. AFL ablation is safe and effective.

Cavotricuspid-isthmus dependent AFL is usually initiated by short bursts of AF. The incidence of AF after AFL ablation is variable. We evaluated the variation in the reported incidence of AF depending on the type and duration of follow-up, and AF incidence in patients with prior AF versus no prior AF. A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies between January 1996 and April 2015 and abstracts in the last 2 years describing patients who underwent AFL ablation and the subsequent incidence of AF was performed. Forty-eight studies were included (n = 8,257, ablation success rate: 96%, 79% male). Incidence of new-onset AF correlated with follow-up duration (29% for a weighted mean follow-up duration of 30 months). New-onset AF incidence with <2 years follow-up was 12.4% among group 1 (electrocardiogram and symptoms-driven evaluation, n = 759), 19% for group 2 (outpatient Holter monitoring for 1 day to 7 days/year, n = 315), and 45% for group 3 (>7 days/year Holter monitoring or by implanted cardiac devices, n = 178). Mean follow-up duration was 15.3 months, 18.5 months, and 16.3 months, respectively. In patients with and without prior AF, the incidence for AF after AFL ablation was 35.3% during mean follow-up duration of 29.7 months.

The propensity-matched cohort had similar results. In mediation analysis, oral anticoagulation prescription within 90 days of diagnosis may have mediated reductions in stroke but did not mediate reductions in survival. In patients with newly diagnosed AF, cardiology care was associated with improved outcomes, potentially mediated by early prescription of oral anticoagulation therapy.

Detection of atrial fibrillation after cryptogenic stroke has therapeutic implications. We conducted a randomized, controlled study of 441 patients to assess whether long-term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) is more effective than conventional follow-up (control) for detecting atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Patients 40 years of age or older with no evidence of atrial fibrillation during at least 24 hours of ECG monitoring underwent randomization within 90 days after the index event. The primary end point was the time to first detection of atrial fibrillation (lasting >30 seconds) within 6 months. Among the secondary end points was the time to first detection of atrial fibrillation within 12 months. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Secondary outcomes included AF rehospitalisation and death. Long-term risks of outcomes were examined by multivariable Cox regression analysis. The most common precipitants were infection (55.0%), surgery (13.2%) and myocardial infarction (12.0%). The 5-year absolute risk of thromboembolic events (taking death into account as a competing risk) in patients with AF grouped according to secondary precipitants were 8.3% (alcohol intoxication), 8.5% (thyrotoxicosis), 12.1% (myocardial infarction), 11.6% (surgery), 12.2% (infection), 10.1% (>1 precipitant) and 12.3% (no secondary precipitant).

Early rhythm control included treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs or atrial fibrillation ablation after randomization. Usual care limited rhythm control to the management of atrial fibrillation-related symptoms. The first primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, or hospitalization with worsening of heart failure or acute coronary syndrome; the second primary outcome was the number of nights spent in the hospital per year.

Outcomes were examined in 233 prospectively enrolled children with CHD (including 64 with a recognized genetic disorder) who underwent CPB between 2004 and 2009. Follow-up assessment included standardized neurologic, motor, and cognitive tests. Variables were collected prospectively, and multiple regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for adverse outcome. The mean patient age at assessment was 6.3 years (range, 5.1-6.8 years). IQ was lower in children with a genetic disorder (median, 55; range, 17-115) compared with children without a genetic disorder (median, 95; range, 47-135; P < .001). Cognitive and motor performance also were lower in children without a genetic disorder compared with the norm (P < .01 for both). The prevalence of children without a genetic disorder performing below -2 SD (IQ 70) was higher than the norm (5.3% vs 2.3%; P = .008), and the prevalence of poor motor performance (<10th percentile) ranged from 21.2% to 41.1% (P < .01 for all). Significant independent risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental outcome included a genetic disorder, longer length of intensive care stay, lower birth weight, postoperative seizures, and lower socioeconomic status. Current cohorts of children with CHD undergoing CPB show favorable outcomes but remain at risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, particularly those with a genetic disorder and a complicated postoperative course.

We meta-analyzed HRQOL outcomes reported by people with a Fontan circulation or their proxies and evaluated predictors of poorer HRQOL. Methods and Results Six electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language articles published before March 2019. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated using fixed and random-effects models. Fifty articles reporting on 29 unique studies capturing HRQOL outcomes for 2793 people with a Fontan circulation and 1437 parent-proxies were analyzed. HRQOL was lower in individuals with a Fontan circulation compared with healthy referents or normative samples (SMD, -0.92; 95% CI, -1.36 to -0.48; <i>P</i><0.001). Lower scores were reported across all HRQOL domains, with the largest differences found for physical (SMD, -0.90; 95% CI, -1.13 to -0.67; <i>P</i><0.001) and school/work functioning (SMD, -0.71; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.52; <i>P</i><0.001). Meta-regression analyses found no significant predictors of self-reported physical functioning, but older age at Fontan operation was associated with poorer emotional functioning (β=-0.124; <i>P</i>=0.004), and diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart was associated with poorer social functioning (β=-0.007; <i>P</i>=0.048).

Despite this, some pediatric cardiology programs are increasingly choosing to partner with their institutional palliative care teams. Why is this? The field of palliative care also has experienced significant shifts over a similar period of time. Today's palliative care is focused on improving quality of life for any patient with a serious or life-threatening condition, regardless of where they might be on their disease trajectory. Research has clearly demonstrated that improved outcomes can be achieved for a variety of patient cohorts through early integration of palliative care; recent evidence suggests that the same may be true in pediatric cardiology. All pediatric cardiologists need to be aware of what pediatric palliative care has to offer their patients, especially those who are not actively dying. This manuscript reviews the evolution of palliative care and provides a rationale for its integration into the care of children with advanced heart disease. Readers will gain a sense of how and when to introduce palliative care to their families, as well as insight into what pediatric palliative care teams have to offer. Additional research is required to better delineate optimal partnerships between palliative care and pediatric cardiology so that we may promote maximal quality of life for patients concurrently with continued efforts to push the boundaries of quantity of life.",success

Medical records of children who underwent SCT at Boston Children's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for any indication from September 2004 to December 2012 and did not survive were reviewed. Child demographic and clinical characteristics and PPC consultation and EOL care patterns were abstracted. Children who received PPC (PPC group) were compared with those who did not (non-PPC group). Children who received PPC consultation (n = 37) did not differ from the non-PPC group (n = 110) with respect to demographic or clinical characteristics, except they were more likely to have undergone unrelated allogeneic SCT (PPC, 68%; non-PPC, 39%; P = .02) or to have died from treatment-related toxicity (PPC, 76%; non-PPC, 54%; P = .03). PPC consultation occurred at a median of .7 months (interquartile range [IQR], .4 to 4.2) before death.

Due to the intense care needed for these children and families, pediatric palliative care (PPC) team consults should be routine; however, medical staff are often reluctant to broach the idea of PPC to families. The involvement of PPC for many carries with it an association to end-of-life (EOL) care. Setting the standard of PPC involvement from the time of admission for the first palliative surgery led to increased family support, decreased days to consult, improved acceptance and communication. The purpose of this article is to describe a quality improvement project of early integration of PPC with families of children with SVCHD. Lessons learned will be presented, including the resources needed and the barriers encountered in assimilating PPC into the standard of care for all patients with SVCHD. The single ventricle (SV) and PPC teams collaborated to enhance the support given to SV families. Education was initiated with cardiology and PPC providers to understand the goal of consistent PPC consults beginning after birth for patients with SVCHD. Parents were educated during fetal consultation regarding the involvement of the PPC team. The SV team ensured compliance with the PPC initiative by identifying eligible patients and requesting consult orders from the primary providers. PPC consultation increased significantly over the 40 month study period to nearly 100% compliance for children with SVCHD who are undergoing pre-Fontan surgery. In addition, mean days to consult decreased dramatically during the study to a current average of 3 days into the patient's hospitalization; the data likely suggest that more PPC consults were routinely ordered versus urgently placed for unexpected complications. Data indicate that patients are being followed by the PPC team at an earlier age and stage in their SV journey which allows for more opportunity to provide meaningful support to these patients and families. The early involvement of the PPC team for children with SV physiology was operationally feasible and was accepted by families, thus allowing PPC providers to establish a therapeutic relationship early in the disease trajectory with the family.

Despite this, timely referral to and integration of PPC into the traditionally cure-oriented cardiac ICU (CICU) remains variable. Despite dramatic declines in mortality in pediatric cardiac disease, key challenges confront the CICU community. Given increasing comorbidities, technological dependence, lengthy recurrent hospitalizations, and interventions risking significant morbidity, many patients in the CICU would benefit from PPC involvement across the illness trajectory. Current PPC delivery models have inherent disadvantages, insufficiently address the unique aspects of the CICU setting, place significant burden on subspecialty PPC teams, and fail to use CICU clinician skill sets. We therefore propose a novel conceptual framework for PPC-CICU integration based on literature review and expert interdisciplinary, multi-institutional consensus-building. This model uses interdisciplinary CICU-based champions who receive additional PPC training through courses and subspecialty rotations. PPC champions strengthen CICU PPC provision by (1) leading PPC-specific educational training of CICU staff; (2) liaising between CICU and PPC, improving use of support staff and encouraging earlier subspecialty PPC involvement in complex patients' management; and (3) developing and implementing quality improvement initiatives and CICU-specific PPC protocols.

In this review, we synthesize the evidence from randomized clinical trials of palliative care interventions in HF. While the evidence base for palliative care in HF is promising, it is still in its infancy and requires additional high-quality, methodologically sound studies to clearly elucidate the role of palliative care for patients and families living with the burdens of HF. Yet, an increase in attention to primary palliative care (e.g., basic physical and emotional symptom management, advance care planning), provided by primary care and cardiology clinicians, may be a vehicle to address unmet palliative needs earlier and throughout the illness course.",success

Currently, data from more than 3,000 children with cardiomyopathy have been entered in the PCMR database with annual follow-up continuing until death, heart transplant, or loss-to-follow up. Using PCMR data, the incidence of cardiomyopathy in two large regions of the United States is estimated to be 1.13 cases per 100,000 children. Only 1/3 of children had a known etiology at the time of cardiomyopathy diagnosis. Diagnosis was associated with certain patient characteristics, family history, echocardiographic findings, laboratory testing, and biopsy. Greater incidence was found in boys and infants (<1 yr) for both dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (DCM, HCM) and black race for only DCM. In DCM, prognosis is worse in older children (>1yr), heart failure (HF) at diagnosis or idiopathic etiology. For HCM, worse prognosis is associated with inborn errors of metabolism or combination of HCM and another cardiomyopathy functional type.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnancies among women with CHD in the modern era. Methods and Results We conducted a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature published January 2007 through June 2019. Studies were included if they reported on maternal or fetal mortality and provided data by CHD lesion. Meta-analysis was performed using random effect regression modeling using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (v3). CHD lesions were categorized as mild, moderate, and severe to allow for pooling of data across studies. Of 2200 articles returned by our search, 32 met inclusion criteria for this study. Overall, the rate of neonatal mortality was 1%, 3.1%, and 3.5% in mild, moderate, and severe lesions, respectively. There were too few maternal deaths in any group to pool data. The rates of maternal and neonatal morbidity among women with CHD increase with severity of lesion. Specifically, rates of maternal arrhythmia and heart failure, cesarean section, preterm birth, and small for gestational age neonate are all markedly increased as severity of maternal CHD increases. Conclusions In the modern era, pregnancy in women with CHD typically has a successful outcome in both mother and child. However, as maternal CHD severity increases, so too does the risk of numerous morbidities and neonatal mortality.

Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess preoperative, intraoperative, and immediate postoperative severity of illness variables as candidate predictors. We used generalized estimating equations to account for clustering of patients within hospital and obtain robust SEs. Bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples) was used to derive bias-corrected 95% CIs around each predictor and validate the model. The final model was used to calculate expected mortality at each hospital. We calculated a standardized mortality ratio (observed-to-expected mortality) for each hospital and derived 95% CIs around the standardized mortality ratio estimate. Hospital standardized mortality ratio was considered a statistically significant outlier if the 95% CI did not include 1. Significant preoperative predictors of mortality in the final model included age, chromosomal abnormality/syndrome, previous cardiac surgeries, preoperative mechanical ventilation, and surgical complexity. Significant early postoperative risk factors included open sternum, mechanical ventilation, maximum vasoactive inotropic score, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed by a convenience sample of 176 patients, aged 8-18 years, being seen in a pediatric cardiology clinic. Three cardiologists enrolled in this study reviewed the completed PedsQL during the clinic visit and recorded their responses to items reported to be a problem ""Often"" or ""Almost Always."" This utilization of the instrument was compared to standardized scoring and the practicality and perceived usefulness of the practice was evaluated by physician interview. PedsQL responses showed 38% of patients reporting significant (Often or Almost Always) problems on at least one domain (19% Physical Functioning, 18.2% Emotional Functioning, 11.4% Social Functioning, and 22.3% School Functioning problems). Using standardized scoring, the prevalence of scores below the cutoff score for clinically significant impaired QOL in each domain ranged from 10% to 20%, with agreement between scoring methods ranging from 89% to 93%, sensitivity 68% to 86%, and specificity 89% to 97%. Cardiologists reported interventions in 30.1% of patients.

Methods and Results A longitudinal survey study of parents and physicians caring for patients with advanced heart disease age 30 days to 19 years admitted for ≥7 days was performed over a 1-year period (n=160 pairs). Percentage agreement and weighted kappa statistics were used to assess agreement. Median patient age was 1 year (interquartile range, 1-5), 39% had single-ventricle lesions, and 37% were in the cardiac intensive care unit. Although 92% of parents reported understanding their child's prognosis ""extremely well"" or ""well,"" 28% of physicians thought parents understood the prognosis only ""a little,"" ""somewhat,"" or ""not at all."" Better parent-reported prognostic understanding was associated with greater preparedness for their child's medical problems (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.4-21.7, <i>P</i>=0.02). There was poor parent-physician agreement in assessing functional class, symptom burden, and likelihood of limitations in physical activity and learning/behavior; on average, parents were more optimistic. Many parents (47%) but few physicians (6%) expected the child to have normal life expectancy. Conclusions Parents and physicians caring for children with advanced heart disease differed in their perspectives regarding prognosis and disease burden. Physicians tended to underestimate the degree of parent-reported symptom burden. Parents were less likely to expect limitations in physical activity, learning/behavior, and life expectancy.

Few drugs are available principally for their symptomatic effect despite the fact that most patients' symptoms persist or worsen over time and an acceptance that the survival gains of modern therapies are mitigated by poorly controlled symptoms. Additional contributors to the failure to focus on symptoms could be the result of under-reporting of symptoms by patients and carers and a reliance on insensitive symptomatic categories in which patients frequently remain despite additional therapies. Hence, formal symptom assessment tools, such as questionnaires, can be useful prompts to encourage more fidelity and reproducibility in the assessment of symptoms.

The ADAPT intervention involves a multidisciplinary team-a registered nurse, social worker, palliative care specialist, and primary care provider (with access to a pulmonologist and cardiologist)-who meet weekly to make recommendations and write orders for consideration by participants' individual primary care providers. The nurse and social worker interact with participants over six visits to identify and manage a primary bothersome symptom and complete a structured psychosocial intervention and advance care planning. The primary outcome is change in patient-reported quality of life at 6 months as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-General questionnaire. Secondary outcomes at 6 months include change in symptom distress, depression, anxiety, disease-specific quality of life hospitalizations, and advance care planning communication and documentation. Intervention implementation will be assessed using a mixed-methods approach including a qualitative assessment of participants' and intervention personnel experiences and a quantitative assessment of care delivery, resources, and cost. The ADAPT trial studies an innovative intervention designed to improve quality of life for veterans with common, burdensome illnesses by targeting key underlying factors-symptoms and depression-that impair quality of life but persist despite disease-specific therapies.

We sought to develop an inpatient HF score (HFS) that could be used as a clinical tool and for clinical trials. Pediatric HF clinicians at Stanford reviewed the limitations of existing HFSs, which include lack of calibration to the inpatient setting, omission of gastrointestinal symptoms, need for multiple age-based tools, and scores that prioritize treatment intensity over patient symptoms. To address these, we developed an acute HFS corresponding to the 3 cardinal symptoms of HF: difficulty with breathing, feeding, and activity. The score was iteratively improved over a 3-year pilot phase until no further changes were made. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) across a range of providers was assessed using the final version. Peak HFSs were analyzed against mortality and length of stay (LOS) for all pediatric HF discharges between July and October 2019. The final HFS was a 4-point ordinal severity score for each of the 3 symptom domains (total score 0-12). Among clinicians who scored 12 inpatients with ADHF simultaneously, the intraclass correlation (ICC) was 0.94 (respiratory ICC = 0.89, feeding ICC = 0.85, and activity ICC = 0.80). Score trajectory reflected our clinical impression of patient response to HF therapies across a range of HF syndromes including 1- and 2-ventricle heart disease and reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

Based on current study data, the following statements can be made: There are good data showing clear associations between psychological health and CVD and risk; there is increasing evidence that psychological health may be causally linked to biological processes and behaviors that contribute to and cause CVD; the preponderance of data suggest that interventions to improve psychological health can have a beneficial impact on cardiovascular health; simple screening measures can be used by health care providers for patients with or at risk for CVD to assess psychological health status; and consideration of psychological health is advisable in the evaluation and management of patients with or at risk for CVD.",success

A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between parent and child distress among families affected by pediatric cancer. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using EBSCO (searching PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Academic search Premiere, and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition) and PubMed. The initial search yielded a total of 29,118 articles. Inclusion criteria were that studies assessed the relation between parent and child distress in the context of pediatric cancer, were written in English, and were published in peer-reviewed journals. 28 articles met inclusion criteria. A statistically significant association was found between overall parent and child distress (r = .32, p < .001), such that increased parent-reported distress was associated with increased distress in their children. Significant relationships were also present among each type of parental distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and global distress; rs = .31-.51, ps < .001) and overall child distress. Moderation analyses via meta-regression indicated that parent proxy-report of child symptoms was associated with a stronger relationship between parent and child distress than child self-report of their own distress. Aligned with the social-ecological framework, familial factors appear to be highly relevant in understanding distress following pediatric cancer diagnosis.

Serious illness conversation guides are proving beneficial for patients, families and staff to communicate uncertainty and facilitate shared decision-making toward goal-concordant care. While the literature emphasizes the imperative to provide guidance for clinicians, no practical guide exists for communicating serious illness and prognostic uncertainty when managing children supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and their families. To address this gap, we propose a structured conversation guide for critical early timepoints during pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support relevant for all cannulations and subsequent iterative discussions toward decannulation. The overarching approach defines extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge or temporary support device, part of a larger therapeutic effort toward a specific goal or goals. The Day 0 talk at extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation is brief, disclosing the serious nature of needing this level of support, and sets clear expectations toward a goal. The Day 1 talk provides further details about benefits and burdens of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cultivates prognostic awareness about potential outcomes and elicits families' goals of care with iterative discussions about how extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may promote these goals. If extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is no longer effective to achieve the intended goal, recommendations are provided for discontinuation of support. When death is anticipated or possible, end-of-life planning, contingencies, and escalation limits should be discussed. The communication framework presented can be adapted to unique institutional and clinical settings. Future research is required to investigate utility and potential barriers to implementation.

Evidence-based transition strategies are required. The Congenital Heart Adolescents Participating in Transition Evaluation Research (CHAPTER 2) Study is a two-site cluster randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of a nurse-led transition intervention for 16-17 year olds with moderate or complex CHD. The primary endpoint is excess time to adult CHD care, defined as the time interval between the final pediatric cardiology appointment and the first adult CHD appointment, minus the recommended time interval between these appointments. Secondary endpoints include the MyHeart score (CHD knowledge), Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire score, and need for catheter or surgical re-intervention. Participants are enrolled in clusters based on week of attendance in the pediatric cardiology clinic. The intervention consists of two one-hour individualized sessions between a cardiology nurse and study participant. Session One focuses on knowledge of the participant's CHD, review of their cardiac anatomy and prior interventions, and potential late cardiac complications. Session Two focuses on self-management and communication skills through review and discussion of videos and role-play. The study will recruit 120 participants.

The planning and conducting of interprofessional family meetings are hampered, however, by a lack of clarity about who is doing what and when, which in turn can lead to inefficiencies and uncoordinated efforts. This article describes how members of the IPT interact with one another (what we have termed team-team practices), distinguishing these interactions from how the IPT engages directly with family members (team-family practices) in preparing for and conducting family meetings. Although most research and guidelines have focused on team-family practices that directly affect patient- and family-level outcomes (e.g., safety and satisfaction), team-team practices are needed to coordinate team contributions and optimize the skills of the diverse team. Team members' knowledge and attitudes also contribute to patient and family outcomes as well as team outcomes. Yet without attention to team-team practices before, during, and after a family meeting, the family-level outcomes are less likely to be achieved as are team well-being outcomes (e.g., reduced burnout and staff retention).

This retrospective, comparative study used data from the National Home and Hospice Care Survey, which included a nationally representative sample of paediatric hospice patients. The Pearson chi-square and Wald tests for comparisons were used. MCCC children enrolled in hospice care for over 2 months with multiple visits by hospice staff. They had low symptom burden with minimal discontinuity of care at EOL. Children without MCCC had short length of stays in hospice with few visits by nurses and other clinicians. These children had high symptom burden and significant disenrollment from hospice care to receive more aggressive treatment. The findings revealed significant differences in paediatric hospice care between MCCC and non-MCCC children, which provides critical insight into the quality of hospice care.",success

The primary sample consists of two groups of MIDUS 2 participants (2004-06); (1) parents who experienced the death of a child prior to MIDUS 2 (n = 451) and (2) comparison parents who had not experienced death of any children (n = 1804) (mean age = 63). We also analyzed 52 twin pairs in which one twin experienced the death of a child and 271 twin pairs in which both twins had all living children. Mortality status of parents was assessed in 2017. Parents who had experienced the death of a child had a 32% higher likelihood of early mortality (defined as dying earlier than life expectancy) than their peers who did not have any deceased children, and they were more likely to die of heart disease. Analyses of the twin subsample revealed significantly lower concordance for early mortality among the pairs with a bereaved twin than among control twins, consistent with non-genetic effects. The findings suggest that the death of a child has lasting impacts on the risk of early mortality in bereaved parents.

For a few people, mental disorders or complications in the grieving process ensue. We summarise research on risk factors that increase vulnerability of some bereaved individuals. Diverse factors (circumstances of death, intrapersonal and interpersonal variables, ways of coping) are likely to co-determine excesses in ill-health. We also assess the effectiveness of psychological intervention programmes.

""Transparency Regarding the Treatment Process-<i>TrtTP</i>""; 4. ""Coping Resources-<i>CR</i>""; 5. ""Perceived Situational Control-<i>PSC</i>""). Analyses were conducted with regard to influencing factors and correlations. <b>Results:</b> Sixty-one individuals (<i>n</i> = 40 females, <i>n</i> = 21 males) were interviewed in a tertiary medical care center. Median gestational age at first parental counseling was 28 + 6 weeks. Parental counseling was performed four times (median), mostly by pediatric cardiologists (83.6%). Overall counseling was successful in 46.3%, satisfying in 51.9%, and unsuccessful in 1.9%. Analyses of the analytical dimensions show that counseling was less successful for TOMK (38.3%) and PSC (39%); success rates were higher if additional written information or links to web sources were provided (60 and 70%, respectively).

In the presence of high-risk CHD (37.5%) overall counseling success was lower (26.1%). By cross table analysis and to a low degree of positive correlation in one dimension (ToMK; <i>r</i> = 0.202), counseling tends to be less successful for ToMK, TrtTP, and TiMS if parents have not been counseled by cardiologists.

We investigated the association of timing of diagnosis with parental stress and modifiers of this relationship. We enrolled parents with a fetus/infant diagnosed prenatally (Group 1) or postnatally (Group 2) with CHD requiring intervention prior to newborn discharge. Parents completed a Basic Symptom Inventory (BSI) - at diagnosis, birth, and follow-up. Adjusted mixed effects regression models compared scores. The BSI was completed by 105 families (Group 1, n = 60 and Group 2, n = 45). On regression modeling, anxiety and global stress were lower in Group 1 (effect size -0.19 to -0.62) at diagnosis and birth though not at follow-up. When stratified by gender, Group 1 scores for anxiety and stress were primarily lower in fathers. Within Group 1, mothers scored higher in all domains and later gestational age at diagnosis was associated with higher anxiety and stress. Contrary to prior reports, parents of prenatally diagnosed infants with CHD had lower anxiety and stress than those diagnosed postnatally after adjusting for severity. Identifying those most vulnerable and modifiable risk factors will allow us to appropriately target psychosocial services for families with a CHD diagnosis.",success

Mortality within 1, 3, or 5 years was predicted using classification and regression trees, RFs, and ANN. Each model was trained using cross-validation, then validated in a separate testing set. Model performance was primarily evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve. The training set included 2802 patients, whereas 700 were included in the testing set. RF achieved the best fit to the training data with AUCs of 0.74, 0.68, and 0.64 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality, respectively, and performed best in the testing data, with AUCs of 0.72, 0.61, and 0.60, respectively. Nevertheless, sensitivity was poor across models (training: 0.22-0.58; testing: 0.07-0.49).

Of those who died, patients who had PPC involved in their care were more likely to limit resuscitation efforts before their death. Four patients had advanced directives in place before VAD implant, of which three had PPC consultation before device placement. Three families (5%) refused PPC involvement when offered.

The exact size of the current population of adults with CHD is unknown, but the best available evidence suggests that currently overall prevalence of CHD in the adult population is about 3000 per million. Regional differences in CHD prevalence have been described, due to both variations in incidence and in mortality. Knowledge of demographic variations of CHD may lead to new aetiological insights and may be useful for preventive therapies. Socioeconomic status, education, urbanisation, climatological factors, ethnicity and patient-related factors, such as comorbidity, lifestyle and healthcare-seeking behaviour, may play a role in CHD incidence and mortality. The higher risk of several major cardiac outcomes in males with CHD might well explain at least partly the increased mortality rate in men. Regional differences in quality of life among CHD patients have been reported and although methodological differences may play a role, sociocultural differences warrant further attention. Socioeconomic outcomes in CHD patients, such as lower education, more unemployment and less relationships, might have a different impact on quality of life in different cultures.

Clinicians may experience inhibitors and facilitators to this transition at both the individual and team level which influence the clinicians' willingness to consult subspecialty palliative care.

African American race and Hispanic ethnicity were independent risk factors for mortality (African American: odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.53 and Hispanic: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03-1.60). African American race was also found to be significantly associated with the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mortality while on ECMO, and cardiac arrest. Adjusting the regression model for ECMO and arrest attenuated the impact of African American race on mortality, suggesting that these variables may indeed play a role in explaining the impact of race on mortality for African American patients with myocardial disease. Hispanic ethnicity remained associated with higher risk of mortality despite controlling for all mechanical circulatory support and transplant (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.04-1.63). Children of racial and ethnic minorities hospitalized with cardiomyopathy or myocarditis are more likely to die than their white counterparts, a trend that may be due at least in part to in-hospital differences in care or response to therapy.",success

Hospitalized children with nonneonatal ICU admissions from 2007 to 2018. The primary outcome was palliative care consultation, as identified by the palliative care International Classification of Disease code. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between those with and without palliative care. We used a mixed-effects multivariable model to estimate the independent association between the palliative care and patient characteristics accounting for institution and subject clustering. Hospitalizations were categorized into three mutually exclusive groups for comparative analyses: 1) meeting ICU-specific palliative care criteria, 2) presence of a complex chronic condition not in ICU-specific palliative care criteria, or 3) not meeting ICU-specific palliative care or complex chronic condition criteria. Rates and trends of palliative care consultation were estimated including variation among institutions and variation among subcategories of ICU-specific palliative care criteria. The study cohort included 740,890 subjects with 1,024,666 hospitalizations. About 1.36% of hospitalizations had a palliative care consultation. Palliative care consult was independently associated with older age, female sex, government insurance, inhospital mortality, and ICU-specific palliative care or complex chronic condition criteria. Among the hospitalizations, 30% met ICU-specific palliative care criteria, 40% complex chronic condition criteria, and 30% neither. ICU-specific palliative care patients received more mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, had longer hospital and ICU lengths of stay, and had higher inhospital mortality (p < 0.001). Palliative care utilization increased over the study period with considerable variation between the institutions especially in the ICU-specific palliative care cohort and its subgroups. Palliative care consultation for critically ill children in the United States is low. Palliative care utilization is increasing but considerable variation exists across institutions, suggesting inequity in palliative care allocation among this vulnerable population.

We used data from 1990 to 2019 on people aged 30-79 years from population-representative studies with measurement of blood pressure and data on blood pressure treatment. We defined hypertension as having systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater, diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater, or taking medication for hypertension. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and the proportion of people with hypertension who had a previous diagnosis (detection), who were taking medication for hypertension (treatment), and whose hypertension was controlled to below 140/90 mm Hg (control). The model allowed for trends over time to be non-linear and to vary by age.

Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy.

Systemic hypertension, the most common comorbidity among cancer patients, is a major contributor to the increased risk for developing these adverse cardiovascular events. Cancer and hypertension have common risk factors, have overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms and hypertension may also be a risk factor for some tumor types. Many cancer therapies have prohypertensive effects. Although some of the mechanisms by which these antineoplastic agents lead to hypertension have been characterized, further preclinical and clinical studies are required to investigate the exact pathophysiology and the optimal management of hypertension associated with anticancer therapy. In this way, monitoring and management of hypertension before, during, and after cancer treatment can be improved to minimize cardiovascular risks.

The aim of this second interim analysis was to compare overall survival between the two treatment groups. ENDEAVOR was a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Patients were recruited from 198 hospitals and outpatient clinics in 27 countries in Europe, North America, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients were aged 18 years or older, had relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and had received between one and three previous lines of therapy.

We review our own experience and reports from the literature on hypertension in cyclosporine A (CSA)-treated transplant recipients. Soon after immunosuppression with CSA and corticosteroids, hypertension develops in most patients who undergo transplantation. The blood pressure increases, which are usually moderate, occur universally because of increased peripheral vascular resistance. Disturbances in circadian patterns of blood pressure lead to loss of the normal nocturnal decline, a feature that magnifies hypertensive target effects. Changes in blood pressure sometimes are severe and associated with rapidly developing target injury, including intracranial hemorrhage, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microangiopathic hemolysis. The complex mechanisms that underlie this disorder include alterations in vascular reactivity that cause widespread vasoconstriction. Vascular effects in the kidney lead to reduced glomerular filtration and impaired sodium excretion. Many of these changes affect local regulation of vascular tone, including stimulation of endothelin and suppression of vasodilating prostaglandins. Effective therapy includes use of vasodilating agents, often calcium channel blocking drugs.

Methods We searched PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE and Web of Science databases for randomised controlled trials published until January 2017 that assessed patients with different types of cancer treated with or without tyrosine kinase inhibitors in addition to standard chemotherapy. Results A total of 29,252 patients from 71 randomised controlled trials were included. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment was associated with a higher cardiac ischaemia relative risk (relative risk = 1.69; 95% confidence interval: 1.12-2.57; p = 0.01), with the highest risks observed for sorafenib and patients with renal cancer. Risk of thrombocytopaenia (relative risk = 2.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.73-2.79; p < 0.001) was highest for regorafenib and patients with breast cancer. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was increased after tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (relative risk = 2.53; 95% confidence interval:1.79 - 3.57; p < 0.001), with the highest risks reported for sunitinib and hepatocellular cancer. QT corrected interval prolongation (relative risk = 6.25; 95% confidence interval: 3.44-11.38; p < 0.001) and arterial hypertension (relative risk = 3.78; 95% confidence interval: 3.15-4.54; p < 0.001) were reported. The relative risks of arterial adverse events, cerebral ischaemia, venous adverse events and pulmonary embolism were similar across groups. Conclusion Tyrosine kinase inhibitors increase the risk of severe cardiovascular and particularly thrombotic adverse events. Specific treatment regimens when prescribing tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies appear desirable.",success

Consecutive mCRC patients who were treated with second-line chemotherapy were retrospectively enrolled. Overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety were assessed. Subgroup analyses of prognostic and predictive efficacy markers were performed. A total of 119 (41.2%), 107 (37.0%), and 63 patients (21.8%) were treated with FOLFIRI +BEV, RAM, or AFL, respectively. ORR, PFS, and OS showed no significant differences between three groups. However, the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) in the FOLFIRI +AFL group was significantly higher than that in the other groups (p < 0.001). Patients with grade 3 or 4 AEs, especially hypertension and neutropenia within the first four cycles of treatment had significantly longer PFS and OS than those without AEs, irrespective of treatment with VEGF inhibitors (p < 0.001). PFS in patients without prior BEV exposure was also significantly longer than that in patients with prior BEV exposure (p = 0.003). Chemotherapeutic efficacy did not differ between the groups. Grade 3 or 4 AEs within the first four cycles of treatment and prior BEV exposure may be an effective predictor of treatment efficacy in mCRC patients administered VEGF inhibitors as second-line chemotherapy.",success

We questioned whether changes in vascular redox state may be important, because VEGF signaling involves nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species. Molecular mechanisms, including NOS, NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived reactive oxygen species, antioxidant systems, and vasoconstrictor signaling pathways, were probed in human endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle exposed to vatalanib, a VEGFI. Vascular functional effects of VEGFI were assessed ex vivo in mouse arteries. Cardiovascular and renal in vivo effects were studied in vatalanib- or gefitinib (EGFI [epidermal growth factor inhibitor])-treated mice. In endothelial cells, vatalanib decreased eNOS (Ser<sup>1177</sup>) phosphorylation and reduced NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, responses associated with increased Nox-derived O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and ONOO<sup>-</sup> formation. Inhibition of Nox1/4 (GKT137831) or Nox1 (NoxA1ds), prevented vatalanib-induced effects. Nrf-2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) nuclear translocation and expression of Nrf-2-regulated antioxidant enzymes were variably downregulated by vatalanib. In human vascular smooth muscles, VEGFI increased Nox activity and stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation. Acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation was impaired and U46619-induced vasoconstriction was enhanced by vatalanib, effects normalized by N-acetyl-cysteine and worsened by L-NAME. In vatalanib-, but not gefitinib-treated mice vasorelaxation was reduced and media:lumen ratio of mesenteric arteries was increased with associated increased cardiovascular and renal oxidative stress, decreased Nrf-2 activity and downregulation of antioxidant genes. We demonstrate that inhibition of VEGF signaling induces vascular dysfunction through redox-sensitive processes. Our findings identify Noxs and antioxidant enzymes as novel targets underling VEGFI-induced vascular dysfunction. These molecular processes may contribute to vascular toxicity and hypertension in VEGFI-treated patients.",success
20051825,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Hypertension is a common side effect in cancer patients treated with inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 signaling and may represent a marker of clinical benefit. Functional rarefaction (a decrease in perfused microvessels) or structural rarefaction (a reduction in anatomic capillary density) may play an important role in the development of hypertension. We investigated whether sunitinib caused impairment of microvascular function and/or reduction of capillary density in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC). Sixteen mRCC patients were treated with sunitinib (50 mg/day). Assessments of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, microvascular endothelial function by laser Doppler fluxmetry, and capillary density by capillary microscopy were performed at baseline and days 14 and 28. Median blood pressure had increased on day 14 (systolic 10 mmHg, P<0.01 and diastolic blood pressure 8 mmHg, P<0.01). Capillary density had decreased from 69 to 61 capillaries/mm (P<0.01). This decrease was related to the increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r=-0.57, P<0.05 and r=-0.68, P<0.01, respectively). A more pronounced decrease in capillary density was associated with increased visibility of the subpapillary plexus (P=0.041). Preliminary findings indicated that median progression-free survival was significantly prolonged in patients with a greater than 6 capillaries/mm decrease in density as compared with patients with a less pronounced decrease (P=0.044). In conclusion, reduction in skin capillary density is associated with a rise in blood pressure during sunitinib therapy and, by itself, might be useful as a predictive marker of clinical outcome.",success

Randomized clinical trials reporting on CVAEs in patients with melanoma being treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors compared with patients with melanoma being treated with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy were selected. Data assessment followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were determined using random-effects and fixed-effects analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess study-level characteristics associated with CVAEs. The selected end points were pulmonary embolism, a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction, arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and QTc interval prolongation. All-grade and high-grade (≥3) CVAEs were recorded. Overall, 5 randomized clinical trials including 2317 patients with melanoma were selected. Treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of pulmonary embolism (RR, 4.36; 95% CI, 1.23-15.44; P = .02), a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (RR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.74-7.94; P < .001), and arterial hypertension (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.12-1.97; P = .005) compared with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy.

Predicted long-term Pt exposure was related to renal function and to late effects of treatment assessed median 9 (3-15) years after chemotherapy. Decay of Pt was best described by a two-compartment model. Mean terminal T1/2 was 3.7 (range 2.5-5.2) years.

One eligible study reported an increased risk of glomerular dysfunction after concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides and vancomycin in CCS receiving total body irradiation (TBI). Four non-eligible studies assessing a total cohort of CCS, found nephrectomy and (high-dose (HD)) ifosfamide as risk factors for decreased GFR. The majority also reported cisplatin as a risk factor. In addition, two non-eligible studies showed an association of a longer follow-up period with glomerular dysfunction.Twenty-two out of 52 studies, including 851 participants, studied proteinuria, which was present in 3.5% to 84% of participants. Risk factors, analysed by three non-eligible studies, included HD cisplatin, (HD) ifosfamide, TBI, and a combination of nephrectomy and abdominal radiotherapy. However, studies were contradictory and incomparable.Eleven out of 52 studies assessed hypophosphataemia or tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR), or both. Prevalence ranged between 0% and 36.8% for hypophosphataemia in 287 participants, and from 0% to 62.5% for impaired TPR in 246 participants. One non-eligible study investigated risk factors for hypophosphataemia, but could not find any association.Four out of 52 studies, including 128 CCS, assessed the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia, which ranged between 13.2% and 28.6%. Both non-eligible studies investigating risk factors identified cisplatin as a risk factor. Carboplatin, nephrectomy and follow-up time were other reported risk factors.The prevalence of hypertension ranged from 0% to 50% in 2464 participants (30/52 studies). Risk factors reported by one eligible study were older age at screening and abdominal radiotherapy. A non-eligible study also found long follow-up time as risk factor. Three non-eligible studies showed that a higher body mass index increased the risk of hypertension. Treatment-related risk factors were abdominal radiotherapy and TBI, but studies were inconsistent.Because of the profound heterogeneity of the studies, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses. Risk of bias was present in all studies. The prevalence of adverse renal effects after treatment with cisplatin, carboplatin, ifosfamide, radiation therapy involving the kidney region, nephrectomy, or any combination of these, ranged from 0% to 84% depending on the study population, received treatment combination, reported outcome measure, follow-up duration and methodological quality. With currently available evidence, it was not possible to draw solid conclusions regarding the prevalence of, and treatment-related risk factors for, specific adverse renal effects. Future studies should focus on adequate study designs and reporting, including large prospective cohort studies with adequate control groups when possible. In addition, these studies should deploy multivariable risk factor analyses to correct for possible confounding. Next to research concerning known nephrotoxic therapies, exploring nephrotoxicity after new therapeutic agents is advised for future studies. Until more evidence becomes available, CCS should preferably be enrolled into long-term follow-up programmes to monitor their renal function and blood pressure.",success
25353395,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) despite current prophylaxis. Methotrexate (MTX) with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) is the current standard, however, has several toxicities. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is frequently used in reduced-intensity HCT, but data in myeloablative transplants is limited. We thus retrospectively identified 241 patients who underwent myeloablative HCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor; 174 patients received cyclosporine (CSA) + MMF and 67 received CSA+MTX. Patients receiving MMF + CSA had rapid neutrophil (median 11 vs. 19 days with MTX+CSA), and platelet recovery (median 19 vs. 25 days), lower incidence of severe mucositis by OMAS (19% vs. 53%), and shorter length of hospital stay (median 25 vs. 36 days) (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). There were no significant differences in incidence of grade 2-4 (MMF+CSA 37% vs. MTX+CSA 39%) or 3-4 acute GVHD (17% vs. 12%), chronic GVHD (46% vs. 56%), relapse (28% vs. 27%), non-relapse mortality (20% vs. 27%), or overall survival (47% vs. 44%) (P = NS for all). However, in multivariable analysis, the use of MMF+CSA was associated with an increased risk of severe grade 3-4 acute GVHD (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.2-7.15, P = 0.019). There were no differences between the two regimens in multivariable analyses for other survival outcomes. This analysis demonstrates that the use of MMF in myeloablative sibling donor transplantation is well tolerated. However, there may be an increased risk of severe GVHD with MMF+CSA compared to MTX+CSA. Further studies evaluating optimal dosing strategies are needed.",success

Therapeutic alternatives are recombinant human erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and red blood cell transfusions. To assess the effects of ESAs to either prevent or treat anaemia in cancer patients. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE and other databases. Searches were done for the periods 01/1985 to 12/2001 for the first review, 1/2002 to 04/2005 for the first update and to November 2011 for the current update. We also contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies. Randomised controlled trials on managing anaemia in cancer patients receiving or not receiving anti-cancer therapy that compared the use of ESAs (plus transfusion if needed). Several review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. One review author assessed quality assessment and extracted data, a second review author checked for correctness. This update of the systematic review includes a total of 91 trials with 20,102 participants. Use of ESAs significantly reduced the relative risk of red blood cell transfusions (risk ratio (RR) 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.68, 70 trials, N = 16,093). On average, participants in the ESAs group received one unit of blood less than the control group (mean difference (MD) -0.98; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.78, 19 trials, N = 4,715). Haematological response was observed more often in participants receiving ESAs (RR 3.93; 95% CI 3.10 to 3.71, 31 trials, N = 6,413). There was suggestive evidence that ESAs may improve Quality of Life (QoL). There was strong evidence that ESAs increase mortality during active study period (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.29, 70 trials, N = 15,935) and some evidence that ESAs decrease overall survival (HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11, 78 trials, N = 19,003). The risk ratio for thromboembolic complications was increased in patients receiving ESAs compared to controls (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 57 trials, N = 15,498). ESAs may also increase the risk for hypertension (fixed-effect model: RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.56; random-effects model: RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.33, 31 trials, N = 7,228) and thrombocytopenia/haemorrhage (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42; 21 trials, N = 4,507). There was insufficient evidence to support an effect of ESA on tumour response (fixed-effect RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.06, 15 trials, N = 5,012). ESAs reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions but increase the risk for thromboembolic events and deaths. There is suggestive evidence that ESAs may improve QoL. Whether and how ESAs affects tumour control remains uncertain. The increased risk of death and thromboembolic events should be balanced against the potential benefits of ESA treatment taking into account each patient's clinical circumstances and preferences. More data are needed for the effect of these drugs on quality of life and tumour progression. Further research is needed to clarify cellular and molecular mechanisms and pathways of the effects of ESAs on thrombogenesis and their potential effects on tumour growth.",success
27982677,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Solid organ transplantation is an established treatment modality in patients with end-stage organ damage in cases where other therapeutic options fail. The long-term outcomes of solid organ transplant recipients have improved considerably since the introduction of the first calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) - cyclosporine. In 1984, the potent immunosuppressive properties of another CNI, tacrolimus, were discovered. The immunosuppressive effects of CNIs result from the inhibition of interleukin-2 synthesis and reduced proliferation of T cells due to calcineurin blockade. The considerable side effects that are associated with CNIs therapy include arterial hypertension and nephrotoxicity. The focus of this article was to review the available literature on the pathophysiological mechanisms of CNIs that induce chronic nephrotoxicity and arterial hypertension. CNIs lead to activation of the major vasoconstriction systems, such as the renin-angiotensin and endothelin systems, and increase sympathetic nerve activity. On the other hand, CNIs are known to inhibit NO synthesis and NO-mediated vasodilation and to increase free radical formation. Altogether, these processes cause endothelial dysfunction and contribute to the impairment of organ function. A better insight into the mechanisms underlying CNI nephrotoxicity could assist in developing more targeted therapies of arterial hypertension or preventing CNI nephrotoxicity in organ transplant recipients, including heart transplantation.",success

We included patients who had received treatment with a VEGF-targeted therapy and progressed on or within 9 months of stopping that agent. Patients were randomised via an interactive voice response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to either lenvatinib (24 mg/day), everolimus (10 mg/day), or lenvatinib plus everolimus (18 mg/day and 5 mg/day, respectively) administered orally in continuous 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The randomisation procedure dynamically minimised imbalances between treatment groups for the stratification factors haemoglobin and corrected serum calcium.

The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse event in patients allocated lenvatinib plus everolimus was diarrhoea (ten [20%]), in those assigned single-agent lenvatinib it was proteinuria (ten [19%]), and in those assigned single-agent everolimus it was anaemia (six [12%]). Two deaths were deemed related to study drug, one cerebral haemorrhage in the lenvatinib plus everolimus group and one myocardial infarction with single-agent lenvatinib. Lenvatinib plus everolimus and lenvatinib alone resulted in a progression-free survival benefit for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have progressed after one previous VEGF-targeted therapy.

This is true not only for the normal vasculature but also for the tumor vasculature when VSP inhibitors are used as anti-angiogenic therapies. Generalized endothelial dysfunction predisposes to vasoconstriction, atherosclerosis, platelet activation, and thrombosis (arterial more than venous). All of these have been reported with VSP inhibitors and collectively give rise to vascular toxicities, the most concerning of which are arterial thromboembolic events (ATE). VSP inhibitors include antibodies, acting extracelluarly on VEGF, such as bevacizumab and tyrosine kinases inhibitors, acting intracellularly on the kinase domain of VEGF receptors, such as sunintib and sorafenib. The addition of bevacizumab and VSP tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy to the cancer treatment regimen is associated with a 1.5-2.5-fold and 2.3-4.6-fold increase risk of ATEs, respectively. Risk factors for ATEs while on VSP inhibitor therapy include age older than 65 years, previous thromboembolic events, history of atherosclerotic disease, and duration of VSP inhibitor therapy. In clinical practice, hypertension remains the most commonly noted vascular manifestation of VSP inhibition. Optimal blood pressure goals and preferred therapeutic strategies toward reaching these goals are not defined at present.

Recommended preventive strategies such as administration of intravenous antibiotics before implantation are well-recognized. Uncertainties have remained about the role of various preventive, diagnostic, and treatment measures such as skin antiseptics, pocket antibiotic solutions, antibacterial envelopes, prolonged antibiotics post-implantation, and others. When compared with previous guidelines or consensus statements, the present consensus document gives guidance on the use of novel device alternatives, novel oral anticoagulants, antibacterial envelopes, prolonged antibiotics post-implantation, as well as definitions on minimum quality requirements for centres and operators and volumes. The recognition that an international consensus document focused on management of CIED infections is lacking, the dissemination of results from new important randomized trials focusing on prevention of CIED infections, and observed divergences in managing device-related infections as found in an European Heart Rhythm Association worldwide survey, provided a strong incentive for a Novel 2019 International State-of-the-art Consensus document on risk assessment, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CIED infections.",success

27354859,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Anticoagulants are commonly used drugs that are frequently encountered during device placement. Deciding when to halt or continue the use of anticoagulants is a balance between the risks of thromboembolism versus bleeding. Patients taking warfarin with a high risk of thromboembolism should continue to take their warfarin without interruption during device placement while ensuring their international normalized ratio remains below 3. For patients who are taking warfarin and have low risk of thromboembolism, either interrupted or continued warfarin may be used, with no evidence to clearly support either strategy. There is little evidence to support continuing direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for device implantation. The timing of halting these medications depends largely on renal function. If bleeding occurs, warfarin׳s anticoagulation effect is reversible with vitamin K and activated prothrombin complex concentrate. There are no DOAC reversal agents currently available, but some are under development. Regarding antiplatelet agents, aspirin alone can be safely continued while clopidogrel alone may also be continued, but with a slightly higher bleeding risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy for bare-metal stent/drug-eluting stent implanted within 4 weeks/6 months, respectively, should be continued due to high risk of stent thrombosis; however, if they are implanted after this period, then clopidogrel can be halted 5 days before the procedure and resumed soon after, while aspirin is continued.

Given the differences in infection rates among ICD and CRT patients, 3 different control populations were used: a published benchmark rate for ICD patients, and both site-matched and comorbidity-matched controls groups for CRT patients. Overall, a major CIED infection occurred in 5 of 1,129 patients treated with TYRX (0.4%; 95% confidence interval: 0.0% to 0.9%), significantly lower than the 12-month benchmark rate of 2.2% (p = 0.0023). Among the TYRX-treated CRT cohort, the major CIED infection rate was 0.7% compared with an infection rate of 1.0% and 1.3% (p = 0.38 and p = 0.02) in site-matched and comorbidity-matched control groups, respectively. Among the ICD group, the 12-month infection rate was 0.2% compared with the published benchmark of 2.2% (p = 0.0052). The most common CIED mechanical complication in study patients was pocket hematoma, which occurred in 18 of the 1,129 patients (1.6%; 95% confidence interval: 0.8 to 2.5), which is comparable with a published rate of 1.6%.

Inclusion criteria were: (a) documented CIED infection, (b) studies that reported the timing to device reimplantation and (c) studies that reported the proportion of participants with device reinfection. A meta-analysis of proportions using a random effects model was performed to estimate the pooled device reinfection rate. The primary outcome measure was the rate of CIED reinfection. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. Of the 280 screened studies, 8 met inclusion criteria with an average of 96 participants per study (range 15-220 participants). The pooled incidence rate of device reinfection was 0.45% (95% CI, 0.02% to 1.23%) per person year. A longer time to device reimplantation >72 hours was associated with a trend towards higher rates of reinfection (unadjusted incident rate ratio 4.8; 95% CI 0.9 to 24.3, p=0.06); however, the meta-regression analysis was unable to adjust for important clinical covariates. There did not appear to be a difference in reinfection rates when time to reimplantation was stratified at 1 week. Heterogeneity was moderate (I<sup>2</sup>=61%). The incident rate of reinfection following initial management of CIED infection is not insignificant. Time to reimplantation may affect subsequent rates of device reinfection. Our findings are considered exploratory and significant heterogeneity limits interpretation. CRD4201810960.",success

Strategies for reimplanting hardware after infection vary widely and have not previously been analyzed using a large, multicenter study. The MEDIC (Multicenter Electrophysiologic Device Infection Cohort) prospectively enrolled subjects with cardiovascular-implantable electronic device infections at multiple institutions in the United States and abroad between 2009 and 2012. Reimplantation strategies were evaluated overall, and every patient who relapsed within 6 months was individually examined for clinical information that could help explain the negative outcome. Overall, 434 patients with cardiovascular-implantable electronic device infections were prospectively enrolled at participating centers. During the initial course of therapy, complete device removal was done in 381 patients (87.8%), and 220 of them (57.7%) were ultimately reimplanted with new devices. Overall, the median time between removal and reimplantation was 10 days, with an interquartile range of 6 to 19 days. Eleven of the 434 patients had another infection within 6 months, but only 4 of them were managed with cardiovascular-implantable electronic device removal and reimplantation during the initial infection. Thus, the repeat infection rate was low (1.8%) in those who were reimplanted. Patients who retained original hardware had a 11.3% repeat infection rate. Our study findings confirm that a broad range of reimplant strategies are used in clinical practice. They suggest that it is safe to reimplant cardiac devices after extraction of previously infected hardware and that the risk of a second infection is low, regardless of reimplant timing.",success

The current work seeks to clarify this issue. We retrospectively reviewed institutional data at Mayo Clinic, Minnesota of patients aged ≥ 18 years who developed CIED-IE from January 1, 1991 to February 1, 2016. CIED-IE was defined as echocardiogram reported device lead or valvular vegetation. Regression analyses were used to relate the risk of clinical outcomes to the interval between CIED removal and re-implantation and the location of vegetations. A total of 109 patients met study inclusion criteria. A majority (68.8%) of patients were men and the median age was 68.0 years. Transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed in 95.4% of patients, with valve vegetations detected in 33.9% (n = 37). Survival analysis comparing patients in whom device re-implantation was < 14 days vs. ≥14 days, and further categorized by those with and without valve vegetation, showed a significant difference (P = 0.028); patients with valve vegetation and reimplantation interval < 14 days had the lowest (58.7%) 12-month survival. When adjusted for valve vegetation, longer time interval for reimplantation trended toward increased hospital length of stay (P = 0.079).

Forty-nine patients with systemic infection and hemodynamic-relevant bradyarrhythmia/asystole were temporarily paced using either a conventional pacing wire/catheter (n = 26, reference group) or a permanent bipolar active pacing lead, which was placed transcutaneously in the right ventricle and connected to an external pacing generator (n = 23, external lead group). In both groups, there were no significant differences in patient characteristics. Whereas the sensing values were almost identical, the median pacing threshold was significantly higher in the reference group (1.0 V vs 0.6 V, P < 0.05).

There were no procedural complications. All patients were being treated for an active CIED infection at the time of the procedure. Fourteen patients (82.4%) were completely pacemaker-dependent and four patients (23.5%) had positive blood cultures at the time of the leadless pacemaker implantation. During a median follow-up of 143 days (interquartile range: 57, 181 days), there were no recurrent infections. Simultaneous leadless pacemaker implantation and CIED extraction are safe and feasible in the setting of an active infection. This strategy may be particularly useful in patients that are pacemaker-dependent.",success

Medically indicated preterm birth was defined as a labor induction or a prelabor cesarean in the absence of premature rupture of membranes at preterm gestations. Adjusted relative risk with 95% confidence interval for preterm birth was derived from multivariable logistic regression models, and population attributable fractions were calculated. The preterm birth rate (less than 35 weeks) was 4.6% (n = 31,238), with 23.5% (n = 7,347) of such births being medically indicated.

We hypothesized that women with preeclampsia with severe features would have a higher rate of severe maternal morbidity compared to normotensive women. We also assessed the proportion of severe maternal morbidity diagnoses that were present on admission, in contrast to those arising during the delivery hospitalization. In this retrospective cross-sectional analysis, we assessed rates of severe maternal morbidity diagnoses (eg, renal insufficiency, shock, and sepsis) and procedures (eg, transfusion and hysterectomy) for all 7025 women who delivered at the University of Washington Medical Center from Oct. 1, 2013, through May 31, 2017. Severe maternal morbidity was determined from prespecified International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and procedure codes; all diagnoses were confirmed by chart review.

Maternal demographic and clinical characteristics were compared for women with and without severe maternal morbidity. The χ<sup>2</sup> and Fisher exact tests were used to determine statistical significance. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the associations between maternal demographic and clinical characteristics and severe maternal morbidity.

Severe preeclampsia occurred in 438 deliveries (6.2%). Notably, hypertension was associated with severe maternal morbidity in a dose-dependent fashion, with the strongest association observed for preeclampsia with severe features (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 3.9-7.3). Severe maternal morbidity was also significantly associated with preeclampsia without severe features, chronic hypertension, preterm delivery, pregestational diabetes, and multiple gestation.

Many of the complications associated with preeclampsia lead to early induction of labor or cesarean delivery and subsequent preterm birth. Preeclampsia is more prevalent among African American women than among white women. Differences in prevalence may be, in part, due to African American women being disproportionally affected by risk factors for preeclampsia. African American women also have case fatality rates related to preeclampsia 3 times higher than rates among white women. Inequalities in access to adequate prenatal care may contribute to poor outcomes associated with preeclampsia in African American women.

Given the evidence that treatment can reduce maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, and the well-established accuracy of blood pressure measurements, the USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for preeclampsia results in a substantial benefit for the mother and infant.

Statistical analysis was performed from April 6 to 17, 2020. Mixed-effects regression models were used to display blood pressure trajectories in the first 6 weeks post partum. A total of 1077 women were included (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [5.6] years; 804 of 1017 White [79.1%] and 213 of 1017 Black [20.9%]). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were found to decrease rapidly in the first 3 weeks post partum, with subsequent stabilization (at 6 days post partum: mean [SD] peak systolic blood pressure, 146 [13] mm Hg; mean [SD] peak diastolic blood pressure, 95 [10] mm Hg; and at 3 weeks post partum: mean [SD] peak systolic blood pressure, 130 [12] mm Hg; mean [SD] peak diastolic blood pressure, 85 [9] mm Hg). A significant difference was seen in blood pressure trajectory by race, with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreasing more slowly among Black women compared with White women (mean [SD] peak systolic blood pressure at 1 week post partum: White women, 143 [14] mm Hg vs Black women, 146 [13] mm Hg; P = .01; mean [SD] peak diastolic blood pressure at 1 week post partum: White women, 92 [9] mm Hg vs Black women, 94 [9] mm Hg; P = .02; and mean [SD] peak systolic blood pressure at 3 weeks post partum: White women, 129 [11] mm Hg vs Black women, 136 [15] mm Hg; P < .001; mean [SD] peak diastolic blood pressure at 3 weeks post partum: White women, 84 [8] mm Hg vs Black women, 91 [13] mm Hg; P < .001). At the conclusion of the program, 126 of 185 Black women (68.1%) compared with 393 of 764 White women (51.4%) met the criteria for stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension (P < .001). This study found that, in the postpartum period, blood pressure decreased rapidly in the first 3 weeks and subsequently stabilized. The study also found that, compared with White women, Black women had a less rapid decrease in blood pressure, resulting in higher blood pressure by the end of a 6-week program. Given the number of women with persistent hypertension at the conclusion of the program, these findings also appear to support the importance of ongoing postpartum care beyond the first 6 weeks after delivery.",success

We categorized hypertension as normotensive, chronic hypertension, or pregnancy-induced hypertension. Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using log-linear Poisson regression models, testing for interactions between race/ethnicity and hypertensive status. A total of 65 286 425 women were admitted for delivery during the study period, of whom 7764 were diagnosed with a stroke (11.9 per 100 000 deliveries). Hypertension modified the effect of race/ethnicity (<i>P</i><0.0001 for interaction). Among women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, black and Hispanic women had higher stroke risk compared with non-Hispanic whites (blacks: aRR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.86-2.30; Hispanics: aRR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.98-2.43). Among women with chronic hypertension, all minority women had higher stroke risk (blacks: aRR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.30-2.26; Hispanics: aRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 2.32-5.63; Asian/Pacific Islanders: aRR, 3.62; 95% CI, 2.32-5.63). Among normotensive women, only blacks had increased stroke risk (aRR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28).

Postdischarge outcomes included stroke and myocardial infarction within 30 days and BP control up to 1 year. Among 22 834 adults hospitalized for noncardiovascular diagnoses (mean [SD] age, 65.6 [17.9] years; 12 993 women [56.9%]; 15 963 White patients [69.9%]), 17 821 (78%) had at least 1 hypertensive BP recorded during their admission. Of these patients, 5904 (33.1%) were treated. A total of 8692 of 106 097 cases (8.2%) of hypertensive systolic BPs were treated; of these, 5747 (66%) were treated with oral medications. In a propensity-matched sample controlling for patient and BP characteristics, treated patients had higher rates of subsequent acute kidney injury (466 of 4520 [10.3%] vs 357 of 4520 [7.9%]; P < .001) and myocardial injury (53 of 4520 [1.2%] vs 26 of 4520 [0.6%]; P = .003). There was no BP interval in which treated patients had better outcomes than untreated patients. A total of 1645 of 17 821 patients (9%) with hypertension were discharged with an intensified antihypertensive regimen. Medication intensification at discharge was not associated with better BP control in the following year. In this cohort study, hypertension was common among medical inpatients, but antihypertensive treatment intensification was not. Intensification of therapy without signs of end-organ damage was associated with worse outcomes.",success
21890093,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Approximately 1% to 2% of patients with hypertension will have a hypertensive emergency at some time in their life. However, no data are available on the frequency of hospitalizations for a hypertensive emergency after the publication of the Seventh Joint National Committee (JNC7) on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure. We sought to explore the changes in the frequency of hospitalizations and in-hospital mortality for hypertensive emergencies before and after the JNC7 report. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2000 to 2007, adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of a hypertensive emergency were identified through appropriate ""International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification"" codes. A total of 456,259 hospitalizations with the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency occurred from the start of calendar year 2000 to the end of calendar year 2007. After adjusting for the United States census for 2000 and American Community Survey estimates for 2007 for adults, the frequency of hospitalizations with a hypertensive emergency increased in United States adults from 101/100,000 in 2000 to 111/100,000 in 2007, an average increase of about 1.11%. Despite the increase in hospitalizations, the all-cause in-hospital mortality rate decreased from 2.8% in the pre-JNC7 era to 2.6% in the post-JNC7 era (odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.96). In conclusion, the results of the present study have shown that although the number of patients with hypertensive emergency increased from 2000 to 2007, the mortality rates decreased significantly after the JNC7 guidelines.",success
35788558,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Racial, gender, and socioeconomic status have been shown to impact the delivery of care. How this impacts the management of hypertensive crisis remains unclear. We aim to identify disparities on admission frequency and length of stay (LOS) among those presenting with hypertensive crisis, as a function of household income. This is a cross-sectional analysis of 2016 emergency department visits and supplemental inpatient data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Median household income quartiles were established. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate odds of admission in each income quartile. A multivariable linear regression model was used to predict LOS. After applying sample weighting, the total number of emergency department visits was 33 727 with 6906, 25 443, and 1378 visits for hypertensive emergency, hypertensive urgency, and unspecified crisis, respectively. There were 13 191, 8889, 6400, 5247 visits in the (first) lowest, second, third , and fourth (highest) income quartiles, respectively. The median age for the study population was 60. The most common comorbidity was chronic kidney disease. Individuals with the highest income, had a lower likelihood of admission, compared with the lowest quartile (adjusted odds ratio: 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.74). There was a significant association between income quartile and LOS among hypertensive emergency patients (beta coefficient: 0.407, P value = 0.019). In this study, patients with lower income were more likely to be admitted, whereas those with higher income exhibited a longer LOS. Clinicians must be made aware these disparities to ensure equitable delivery of care.",success

Little is known about progress in reducing hospitalizations for acute hypertension. We conducted serial cross-sectional analysis of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries age 65 years or older between 1999 and 2019 using Medicare denominator and inpatient files. We evaluated trends in national hospitalization rates for acute hypertension overall and by demographic and geographical subgroups. We identified all beneficiaries admitted with a primary discharge diagnosis of acute hypertension on the basis of International Classification of Diseases codes. We then used a mixed effects model with a Poisson link function and state-specific random intercepts, adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, and dual-eligible status, to evaluate trends in hospitalizations. The sample consisted of 397 238 individual Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. From 1999 through 2019, the annual hospitalization rates for acute hypertension increased significantly, from 51.5 to 125.9 per 100 000 beneficiary-years; the absolute increase was most pronounced among the following subgroups: adults ≥85 years (66.8-274.1), females (64.9-160.1), Black people (144.4-369.5), and Medicare/Medicaid insured (dual-eligible, 93.1-270.0). Across all subgroups, Black adults had the highest hospitalization rate in 2019, and there was a significant increase in the differences in hospitalizations between Black and White people from 1999 to 2019. Marked geographic variation was also present, with the highest hospitalization rates in the South. Among patients hospitalized for acute hypertension, the observed 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality rates (95% CI) decreased from 2.6% (2.27-2.83) and 5.6% (5.18-5.99) to 1.7% (1.53-1.80) and 3.7% (3.45-3.84) and 30-day and 90-day all-cause readmission rates decreased from 15.7% (15.1-16.4) and 29.4% (28.6-30.2) to 11.8% (11.5-12.1) and 24.0% (23.5-24.6). Among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries age 65 years or older, hospitalization rates for acute hypertension increased substantially and significantly from 1999 to 2019. Black adults had the highest hospitalization rate in 2019 across age, sex, race and ethnicity, and dual-eligible strata. There was significant national variation, with the highest rates generally in the South.",success

The aim of the present study was to evaluate adherence to prescribed antihypertensives and potential interactions of concomitant drugs and foods with prescribed antihypertensives in patients with HTN-C by a direct evaluation via biochemical urine analysis. In the present cross-sectional study, 100 patients with HTN-C, admitted to the emergency department (ED), were included. A biochemical urine analysis using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed. Out of 100 patients, 86 received antihypertensives. Urine analyses could be evaluated unambiguously in 62 patients. In 15 of these 62 patients (24%), a nonadherence could be demonstrated, and in 21 patients (34%), a partial nonadherence could be demonstrated. Patients with nonadherence or partial nonadherence showed a longer hypertension history (15[5-22] vs 10[3-15] years, P = 0.04) were prescribed more general medication (number 7.1 ± 3.4 vs 3.4 ± 1.8; P < 0.01) as well as antihypertensive drugs (number 2.8 ± 1.1 vs 1.5 ± 0.7, P < 0.01). A potential BP-raising trigger by medications or food interaction was frequently detectable, predominantly with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; n = 38), glucocorticoids (n = 8), antidepressants (n = 10), and licorice (n = 10). Nonadherence and partial nonadherence to prescribed antihypertensives might play a crucial role for the occurrence of HTN-C. However, further case-controlled studies are needed to confirm the present findings. Ingestion of concurrent over-the-counter drugs such as NSAIDs but also prescribed drugs as well as aliments may lead to critical BP elevation. In order to prevent HTN-C, the present findings emphasize the importance for clinicians to pay attention to the issue of adherence and co-medication.",success
34905954,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) remain one of the major causes of pregnancy-related maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Affected women are also at increased risk for cardiovascular disease later in life, independently of traditional cardiovascular disease risks. Despite the immediate and long-term cardiovascular disease risks, recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of HDP in the United States have changed little, if at all, over past decades, unlike hypertension guidelines for the general population. The reasons for this approach include the question of benefit from normalization of blood pressure treatment for pregnant women, coupled with theoretical concerns for fetal well-being from a reduction in utero-placental perfusion and in utero exposure to antihypertensive medication. This report is based on a review of current literature and includes normal physiological changes in pregnancy that may affect clinical presentation of HDP; HDP epidemiology and the immediate and long-term sequelae of HDP; the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, an HDP commonly associated with proteinuria and increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease with different clinical phenotypes and likely distinct pathological mechanisms; a critical overview of current national and international HDP guidelines; emerging evidence that reducing blood pressure treatment goals in pregnancy may reduce maternal severe hypertension without increasing the risk of pregnancy loss, high-level neonatal care, or overall maternal complications; and the increasingly recognized morbidity associated with postpartum hypertension/preeclampsia. Finally, we discuss the future of research in the field and the pressing need to study socioeconomic and biological factors that may contribute to racial and ethnic maternal health care disparities.",success
30827125,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is essential for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. This article provides an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on BP measurement in humans. In the office setting, many oscillometric devices have been validated that allow accurate BP measurement while reducing human errors associated with the auscultatory approach. Fully automated oscillometric devices capable of taking multiple readings even without an observer being present may provide a more accurate measurement of BP than auscultation. Studies have shown substantial differences in BP when measured outside versus in the office setting. Ambulatory BP monitoring is considered the reference standard for out-of-office BP assessment, with home BP monitoring being an alternative when ambulatory BP monitoring is not available or tolerated. Compared with their counterparts with sustained normotension (ie, nonhypertensive BP levels in and outside the office setting), it is unclear whether adults with white-coat hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels in the office but not outside the office) have increased cardiovascular disease risk, whereas those with masked hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels outside the office but not in the office) are at substantially increased risk. In addition, high nighttime BP on ambulatory BP monitoring is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Both oscillometric and auscultatory methods are considered acceptable for measuring BP in children and adolescents. Regardless of the method used to measure BP, initial and ongoing training of technicians and healthcare providers and the use of validated and calibrated devices are critical for obtaining accurate BP measurements.",success
25275246,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"No universally accepted guideline exists for measurement of blood pressure for patients confined to bed. The aim was to establish areas of technique that might be open to standardization to improve measurement reliability similar to those used for office BP measurements. In-patient blood pressure measurement (IPBPM) was closely observed in 100 patients in a variety of medical wards during routine vital signs observation rounds, comparing the methods observed with current office BPM guidelines. IPBPM, always taken initially with automated machines, was measured once only in 96% of patients. Around 7% patients were lying flat, 32% semi-reclined, 24% had their back unsupported, 15% crossed legs, 9% arms unsupported, 65% arm below heart level, 4% above, 36% incorrect cuff size for arm circumference, 43% bladder not centred over brachial artery and 14% had arrhythmia not documented by ward staff during the measurement. Staff and patients were conversing during 41% measurements. There is a lack of standardization of automated IPBPM technique including a failure to adhere to principles of measurement already established for office BP in a majority (97%) of patients. This may lead to potentially erroneous BP readings, which are an unreliable basis for clinical interpretation and decision making. There is a need for universal hospital-specific guidelines for IPBPM and programmes to train and monitor staff for adherence to these. Particular attention should be given to those factors well known to affect blood pressure measurement, including correct cuff size and placement, arm position and absence of talking during measurement as well as only using validated machines. Additional recommendations might include the routine use of manual BP readings where appropriate (such as with very low or irregular heart rates), BP measured in both arms on admission and the arm with the highest BP used thereafter and recording the side of IPBPM and patient position. We recommend that a task force is commissioned to develop universal guidelines for this important part of clinical assessment.",success

The erroneous interpretations of blood pressure (BP) may lead to clinical errors. To test the accuracy and reliability of aneroid (ABP) and oscillometric (OBP) devices compared to the invasive BP (IBP) monitoring in an ICU population. Fifty adult patients (200 comparisons) were included in a randomized crossover trial. BP was recorded simultaneously by IBP and either by ABP or by OBP, taking IBP as gold standard. Compared with ABP, IBP systolic values were significantly higher (mean difference ± standard deviation 9.74 ± 13.8; P < 0.0001). Both diastolic (-5.13 ± 7.1; P < 0.0001) and mean (-2.14 ± 7.1; P=0.0033) IBP were instead lower. Compared with OBP, systolic (10.80 ± 14.9; P < 0.0001) and mean (5.36 ± 7.1; P < 0.0001) IBP were higher, while diastolic IBP (-3.62 ± 6.0; P < 0.0001) was lower. Bland-Altman plots showed wide limits of agreement in both NIBP-IBP comparisons. BP measurements with different devices produced significantly different results. Since in critically ill patients the importance of BP readings is often crucial, noninvasive techniques cannot be regarded as reliable alternatives to direct measurements.",success
