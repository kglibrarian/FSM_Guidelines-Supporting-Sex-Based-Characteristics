Little is known about the effect of aerosol box use on HCP contamination and AGMP procedure time. To investigate whether use of an aerosol box during AGMPs reduces HCP contamination or influences the time to successful completion and first-pass success rate for endotracheal intubation (ETI) and laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion. This multicenter, simulation-based, randomized clinical trial was conducted from May to December 2021 at tertiary care pediatric hospitals. Participant teams performed 3 simulated patient scenarios: bag-valve-mask ventilation, ETI, and LMA insertion. During the scenarios, aerosols were generated using Glo Germ. Teams of 2 HCPs were randomly assigned to control (no aerosol box) or intervention groups (aerosol box). Statistical analysis was performed from July 2022 to February 2023. The aerosol box (or SplashGuard CG) is a transparent, plastic barrier covering the patient's head and shoulders with access ports allowing HCPs to manage the airway. The primary outcome was surface area of contamination (AOC) on participants. Secondary outcomes were time to successful completion and first-pass success rates for ETI and LMA insertion. A total of 64 teams (128 participants) were enrolled, with data from 61 teams (122 participants) analyzed. Among the 122 participants analyzed, 79 (64.8%) were female and 85 (69.7%) were physicians. Use of an aerosol box was associated with a 77.5% overall decreased AOC to the torso (95% CI, -86.3% to -62.9%; P < .001) and a 60.7% overall decreased AOC to the facial area (95% CI, -75.2% to -37.8%; P < .001) in airway HCPs. There was no statistically significant difference in surface contamination after doffing personal protective equipment between groups. Time to completing ETI was longer in the aerosol box group compared with the control group (mean difference: 10.2 seconds; 95% CI, 0.2 to 20.2 seconds; P = .04), but there was no difference between groups for LMA insertion (mean difference: 2.4 seconds; 95% CI, -8.7 to 13.5 seconds; P = .67). In this randomized clinical trial of aerosol box use in AGMPs, use of an aerosol box reduced contamination deposition on HCPs' torso and face predoffing; the use of an aerosol box delayed time to successful intubation. These results suggest that the incremental benefits of reduced surface contamination from aerosol box use should be weighed against delayed time to complete intubation, which may negatively affect patient outcome.

The study was carried out in a training and simulation emergency box and the total sample consisted of 20 healthcare professionals. Two CPR tests were compared with the recommended sequence of 30 chest compressions and 2 ventilations. The duration of each test was 20 min. One of the CPR tests was carried out without using any PPE (CPR_control), i.e., performed with the usual clothing of each rescuer. The other test was carried out using a CPR test with PPE (i.e., CPR_PPE). The main variables of interest were: CPR quality, compressions, ventilations, maximum heart rate, body fluid loss, body temperature, perceived exertion index, comfort, thermal sensation and sweating. The quality of the CPR was similar in both tests. The maximum heart rate was higher in the active intervals (compressions + bag-valve-mask) of the test with PPE. CPR_PPE meant an increase in the perceived effort, temperature at the start of the thermal sensation test, thermal comfort and sweating, as opposed to CPR performed with usual clothing. Performing prolonged resuscitation with PPE did not influence CPR quality, but caused significant physiological demands. Rescuers were more fatigued, sweated more and their thermal comfort was worse.

Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 was intubated using a video-guided laryngoscope with operators wearing level three PPE; group 2 was intubated using a direct laryngoscope with operators wearing level three PPE; and group 3 was intubated using a direct laryngoscope with operators wearing level two PPE. Intubation was performed by 2nd- and 3rd-year anesthesia residents. The duration of intubation varied significantly among the groups, with Group 1 taking the longest time (P = 0.046). Group 3 had a higher success rate for first-attempt intubation (P = 0.056). The use of PPE and video-guided laryngoscopy had varying effects on the intubation procedure, with the most notable impact being on the overall length of intubation. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to validate these findings.",success

A total of 52 physicians participated in this prospective, observational, randomized crossover study conducted in a medical simulation setting. Participants included COVID-19 patients with cardiac arrest scenarios with and without PPE-AGP who were intubated with ETView and MAC. During intubation without PPE-AGP, ETView showed a similar first-pass success rate (FPS) but had a shorter intubation time and better glottal hydration compared to MAC. In scenario B (with PPE-AGP), ETView outperformed MAC in FPS, initiation time, and glottic visualization. The use of PPE-AGP had little impact on ETView's performance. However, it negatively affected the Macintosh laryngoscope, reducing FPS and glottic visibility. Participants found intubation with ETView easier in both scenarios.

It has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected person's cough or sneeze. Exhaled droplets from infected patients with COVID-19 can be inhaled into the lungs and leads to respiratory illness such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure used to treat pulmonary diseases at home and healthcare settings, it has a potential for fugitive emissions during therapy due to the generation of aerosols and droplets as a source of respiratory pathogens. Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus. This has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy. Due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice, the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild-, sub-intensive, and intensive-care patients with COVID-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy.",success

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, an acute respiratory infectious agent, is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. A recognized key to transmission of COVID-19, and droplet infections generally, is the dispersion of bioaerosols from the patient. Increased risk of transmission has been associated with aerosol generating procedures that include endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The knowledge that COVID-19 subjects can be asymptomatic and still shed virus, producing infectious droplets during breathing, suggests that health care workers (HCWs) should assume every patient is potentially infectious during this pandemic. Taking actions to reduce risk of transmission to HCWs is, therefore, a vital consideration for safe delivery of all medical aerosols. Guidelines for use of personal protective equipment (glove, gowns, masks, shield, and/or powered air purifying respiratory) during high-risk procedures are essential and should be considered for use with lower risk procedures such as administration of uncontaminated medical aerosols. Bioaerosols generated by infected patients are a major source of transmission for SARS CoV-2, and other infectious agents.

Thus, many questions arise with regard to respiratory care after birth, necessary protection to health care workers (HCW) in the delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and safety of bag and mask ventilation, noninvasive respiratory support, deep suctioning, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Indeed, these questions have created tremendous confusion amongst neonatal HCW. In this manuscript, we comprehensively reviewed the current evidence regarding COVID-19 perinatal transmission, respiratory outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 and infants with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the evidence for using different respiratory support modalities and aerosol-generating procedures in this specific population. The results demonstrated that to date, neonatal COVID-19 infection is uncommon, generally acquired postnatally, and associated with favorable respiratory outcomes. The reason why infants display a milder spectrum of disease remains unclear. Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists. Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure.

We used this system to determine the incidence of the breach in biosafety during doffing of PPE among HCWs involved in the care of Covid-19 patients. Methods A total of 100 HCWs were enrolled in this observational study who performed duties in the COVID intensive care unit (ICU) of our tertiary care centre. With a real-time RADS system, trained observers from remote locations assisted HCWs during doffing of PPE and noted breach at any step using the CDC doffing checklist. The breach was considered major if committed during removal of gloves/gown/N-95 or if ≥3 errors occurred in any other steps. Results Overall, 40% of the HCWs committed a breach during doffing at least one step. The majority of the errors were observed during hand hygiene (34%), followed by glove removal (12%) and N-95 removal (8%). Nineteen percent of HCWs committed the major breach, out of which 37.5% were done by house-keeping sanitation staff (p = 0.008 and RR 2.85; 95% CI of 1.313-6.19), followed by technicians (22.5%), nursing staff (16.7%) and resident doctors (6.5%).

Among 434 providers, 362 (83%) were nonadherent with at least 1 PPE. Only 186 of 1,832 instances of nonadherence were corrected, primarily upon room entry and during patient care. Correction time varied by PPE type and nonadherence level (incomplete vs absent). Most corrections were self-initiated, with few reminders from other providers. Potential barriers to correction include a lack of social pressure and external reminders. Solutions include optimizing PPE availability, providing real-time feedback, and educating on double gloving. Most providers were nonadherent to PPE requirements during high-risk infection transmission events. The low correction rate suggests challenges in promoting collective responsibility and maintaining protective behaviors during medical emergencies.",success

At present, there is a lack of data on the quantities, size distributions and spread of aerosol particles generated during such procedures. This was a volunteer observational study which took place in an operating room of a university teaching hospital. Optical particle sizers were used to provide real time aerosol characterisation during a simulated ATI performed with concurrent high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. The particle sizers were positioned at locations that represented the different locations of clinical staff in an operating room during an ATI. The greatest concentration of patient derived aerosol particles was within 0.5-1.0 m of the subject and along their midline, 2242 #/cm<sup>3</sup>. As the distance, both radial and longitudinal, from the subject increased, the concentration decreased towards ambient levels, 36.9 ± 5.1 #/cm<sup>3</sup>. Patient derived aerosol particles < 5 µm in diameter remained entrained in the exhaled aerosol plume and fell to the floor or onto the subject. Patient derived particles > 5 µm in diameter broke away from the exhaled plume and spread radially throughout the operating room.

The mean serum potassium concentration measured during cardiac arrest was 7.2 +/- 1.4 mEq/L (range, 5.9-9.2 mEq/L). The number of RBC units administered before cardiac arrest ranged between 1 (in a 2.7 kg neonate) and 54. Nearly all patients were acidotic, hyperglycemic, hypocalcemic, and hypothermic at the time of arrest. Fourteen (87.5%) patients received RBC via central venous access. Commercial rapid infusion devices (pumps) were used in 8 of 11 (72.7%) of the adult patients, but RBC units were rapidly administered (pressure bags, syringe pumped) in all remaining patients. Mean resuscitation duration was 32 min (range, 2-127 min). The in-hospital survival rate was 12.5%. The pathogenesis of transfusion-associated hyperkalemic cardiac arrest is multifactorial and potassium increase from RBC administration is complicated by low cardiac output, acidosis, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypothermia.

Seventeen chronic renal failure patients referred to the Nephrology Unit between October 1, 1997 and March 31, 1998 for hemodialysis were randomized. Group 1 received salbutamol followed by a placebo. Group 2 received a placebo followed by salbutamol. Each patient inhaled 1,200 microg salbutamol or a placebo through an MDI-S within 2 min. Blood samples were obtained repeatedly before inhalation and after 1, 3, 5, 10, and 60 min. The pulse rate and blood pressure were repeatedly measured. Insulin levels were examined in a subset of patients (n = 10) before, and 1 and 5 min following inhalation. Salbutamol's known side effects, palpitation, tachycardia tremor, and headache, were recorded. Potassium levels rose after 1 min following the completion of treatment and then decreased steadily thereafter. A rise of > or = 0.1 mEq/L was seen in 10 of 17 patients (59%) during the treatment period and there was no change (0%) seen during the placebo period (p < 0.0001). Within 3 min after inhalation of salbutamol, potassium levels declined as a function of time. Potassium levels in those patients taking the placebo did not change as a function of time (p < 0.001). The difference between the placebo and the salbutamol-treated periods reached significance after 5 min (p < 0.05). The serum glucose levels rose following inhalation of salbutamol, with a significant rise after 3 min. The heart rate rose significantly within the first 5 min following inhalation. Serum insulin levels remained unchanged 1 min after inhalation; however, after 5 min, a significant elevation was detected. Salbutamol inhalation of 1,200 microg, using an MDI-S, has a relatively rapid onset of action that induces a consistent reduction in serum potassium levels, starting 3 to 5 min following delivery. Unexpectedly, a paradoxical elevation was detected in serum potassium levels in the first minutes following inhalation. This effect, although minor (0.15 mEq/L above baseline), may cast some doubt on the role of salbutamol inhalation as the first treatment for excessive hyperkalemia.",success

At Ta = 40 degrees C, heat gain exceeded heat loss and led to hyperthermia and heat stroke, and the latency for the onset of heat stroke was found to be around 87 minutes. At the onset of heat stroke, the comatose animals showed higher levels of rectal temperature, ear skin blood flow, respiratory evaporative heat loss, metabolic rate, intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral water content as compared to those of control animals (kept at an ambient temperature of 24 degrees C). Before the start of heat stress, the animals had an average mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) of 94 mm Hg and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) of 80 mm Hg. However, at the onset of heat stroke, the average MABP and CPP decreased to 67 and 19 mm Hg, respectively. The reduction in CPP at the onset of heat stroke was due to both a decrease in MABP and an increase in ICP. In addition, the comatose animals which received an intravenous infusion of 10% glycerol (3 ml/min) had a survival time (interval between onset of heat stroke and death) longer than that of the comatose animals which received the control-vehicle solution. The prolongation of survival time in the glycerol-treated animals may be due to lower rectal temperature, lower cerebral water content, or lower ICP during the development of heat stroke. The present data indicate that not only hyperthermia but also cerebral edema, intracranial hypertension, decreased MABP, and decreased CPP are the main causes of heat stroke.

31628268,False,Comparative Study;Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Clinical Scenario: In the last few years, there have been several studies examining alternative cooling strategies in the treatment of exertional heat stroke (EHS). Morbidity and mortality with EHS are associated with how long the patient's core body temperature remains above the critical threshold of 40.5°C. Although cold-water immersion (CWI) is the gold standard of treatment when cooling a patient with EHS, more recent alternative cooling techniques have been examined for use in settings where CWI may not be feasible (ie, remote locations). Clinical Question: Do alternative cooling methods have effective core body temperature cooling rates for hyperthermia compared with previously established CWI cooling rates? Summary of Key Findings: The authors searched for studies using alternative cooling methods to cool hyperthermic individuals. To be included, the studies needed a PEDro score ≥6 and a level of evidence ≥2. They found 9 studies related to our focused clinical question; of these, 5 studies met the inclusion criteria. The cooling rates for hand cooling, cold-water shower, and ice-sheet cooling were 0.03°C/min, 0.08°C/min, and 0.06°C/min, respectively, whereas the tarp-assisted cooling with oscillation (TACO) method was the only method that had an acceptable cooling rate (range 0.14-0.17°C/min). Clinical Bottom Line: When treating EHS, if CWI is not available, the tarp-assisted cooling method may be a reasonable alternative. Clinicians should not use cold shower, hand cooling, or ice-sheet cooling if better cooling methods are available. Clinicians should always use CWI when available. Strength of Recommendation: Five level 2 studies with PEDro scores ≥6 suggest the TACO method is the only alternative cooling method that decreases core body temperature at a similar, though slower, rate of CWI. Hand cooling, cold showering, and ice-sheet cooling do not decrease core body temperature at an appropriate rate and should not be used in EHS situations if a modality with a better cooling rate is available.",success

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for systemic perfusion and rewarming was initiated. After ECMO was introduced, return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. She showed no neurological impairments at discharge. Muscle rigidity does not rule out the possibility of resuscitation in patients with severe accidental hypothermia under cardiac arrest.

On presentation, she was unresponsive and her core temperature was 22.8 °C. Since rewarming by an electric blanket and warmed saline infusion was ineffective, infusion of warmed peritoneal dialysis solution via an indwelling peritoneal dialysis catheter was performed in the emergency room. In the next few hours, her body temperature recovered to normal level, and she regained consciousness. During resuscitation, complications related to rewarming, such as arrhythmia or hypotension, were not observed. She was discharged without any sequelae.

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) should be used if feasible since it optimally provides both central rewarming and circulatory support. However, this modality may not be available or is contraindicated in certain cases. Thoracic lavage (TL) provides satisfactory heat transfer and may be performed by a variety of physicians. This paper presents the physiological rationale, technique, and role for TL in accidental hypothermia with cardiac arrest. A patient with hypothermic cardiac arrest, treated by the author using TL, serves as the basis for this report. A search of the English language literature using PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland) was conducted from 1966 to 2003 and 13 additional patients were identified. Demographic information, lavage method, rewarming rate, complications, and neurological outcome were analysed. There were numerous causes for hypothermia, with drug and alcohol intoxication being the most common (n = 4; 28.6%). Patient age ranged from 8 to 72 years (median = 36 years). Mean core temperature was 24.5+/-0.60 degrees C. Most patients were without blood pressure or pulse upon presentation to the Emergency Department and the predominant cardiac rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 9; 64.3%). Thoracic lavage was accomplished by thoracotomy in seven patients and tube thoracotomy in the remaining seven. Median rewarming rate was 2.95 degrees C/h. Median time until sinus rhythm was restored was 120 min. Median length of hospital stay was 2 weeks. Four (28.6%) patients died. Complications were seen in 12 (85.7%) patients. Among survivors, neurological outcome was normal in 8 (80%) while two were left with residual impairments.

However, soon, her temperature plateaued at 27 °C. Patient was deemed unsuitable for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) due to her age, and urgent IHD was initiated. This approach resulted in a stable increase in core temperature at approximately 2.0 °C/hr, along with normalization of lactic acidosis, creatinine phosphokinase, and correction of electrolyte imbalances, culminating in her full recovery and discharge after seven days in the hospital.After reviewing this case alongside similar ones from before, this case report highlights the efficacy and safety of IHD as an efficient, readily available, and less invasive method for rewarming moderate to severe hypothermic patients who are hemodynamically unstable patients but do not have cardiac arrest or renal dysfunction. IHD is especially useful when less invasive cooling devices (Artic Sun/ CoolGard) are not available or more invasive extracorporeal life support options (ECMO/ CPB) are either not indicated or unavailable.

Combining all of the published data in a patient-level analysis can provide a robust assessment of the influence of patient characteristics on survival with ECLS. To develop a prediction model of survival with good neurologic outcome for accidental hypothermia treated with ECLS. Electronic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL were conducted with a hand search of reference lists and major surgical and critical care conference abstracts. Studies had to report the use of ECLS configured with a circuit, blood pump and oxygenator with an integrated heat exchanger. Randomized and observational studies were eligible for inclusion. Non-human, non-English and review manuscripts were deemed ineligible. Study authors were requested to submit patient level data when aggregate or incomplete individual patient data was provided in a study. Survival with good neurologic outcome was categorized for patients to last follow-up based on the reported scores on the Cerebral Performance Category (1 or 2), Glasgow Outcome Scale (4 or 5) and Pediatric Overall Performance Category (1 or 2). A one-stage, individual patient data meta-analysis was performed with a mixed-effects multi-level logistic regression model reporting odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Data from 44 observational studies and 40 case reports (n = 658) were combined and analyzed to identify independent predictors of survival with good neurologic outcome. The survival rate with good neurologic outcome of the entire cohort was 40.3% (265 of 658).

Patients who had achieved return of spontaneous circulation before commencement of active rewarming at the hospital were compared to those who remained in cardiac arrest. A total of 156 patients suffering hypothermic cardiac arrest were included in the study. In 14 of them (9%) resuscitation was successful before rewarming. Factors associated with return of spontaneous circulation were as follows: witnessed onset of cardiac arrest (p = 0.04); a higher core body temperature (p = 0.005) with a prognostic threshold of 24.6 °C; and a higher arterial oxygen partial pressure (p = 0.04) with a prognostic threshold of 81 mmHg.

The secondary aim of the study was to evaluate efficacy of VA-ECMO in initial 6-h period of treatment METHODS: From July 2013 to June 2016, thirty one hypothermic patients were accepted for extracorporeal rewarming at Severe Accidental Hypothermia Center, Cracow. Thirteen patients were identified with circulatory instability and were enrolled in the study. The evaluation took into account patients' condition on admission, the course of therapy, and changes in laboratory and hemodynamic parameters. Nine out of 13 analyzed patients survived (69%). Patients who died were older, had lower both systolic and diastolic pressure, and had increased creatinine an potassium levels on admission. In surviving patients, arterial blood gases parameters (pH, BE, HCO<sub>3</sub>) and lactates would normalize more quickly. Their potassium level was lower on admission as well. The values of the core temperature on admission were comparable. Although normothermia was achieved in 92% of patients, none of them had been weaned-off VA-ECMO in the first 6 h of treatment.

The primary outcome was neurologically favorable 1-month survival, defined as cerebral performance category 1 or 2. The secondary outcome was 1-month survival. OHCA cases with hypothermia occurred more frequently in the winter. In approximately half (837) of the hypothermic OHCA cases, EMS was activated in the morning (6:00 am to 11:59 am).

EMS-witnessed cases, prolonged transportation time intervals and prehospital epinephrine administration were associated with rhythm conversion in cases with non-shockable initial rhythms. Binominal logit test followed by multivariable logistic regression revealed that shockable initial rhythms were associated with better outcomes. prehospital defibrillation was not significantly associated with better outcomes, regardless of the type of initial rhythm (shockable or non-shockable).

A 42-year-old man was found unresponsive to external stimuli and pulseless at an outdoor temperature of 1°C. CPR was started at the scene by laypersons, and the emergency medical services (EMS) arrived 5 minutes after the emergency call.

The patient showed signs of severe hypothermia and, during ongoing CPR, was transported to hospital where on arrival the patient's rectal temperature was measured at 22°C. Resuscitation measures were continued and warming was started at the emergency room.

During the follow-up, atrial or ventricular arrhythmias were observed in 11 (33%) patients. The most common rhythm disturbances before L-VAD implantation were ventricular arrhythmias, while after the surgery, atrial arrhythmias were found to be the most frequent.

The last couple of decades has seen a drastic change in the functioning of the left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), changing from the first generation devices running on pulsatile flow to the current continuous flow devices. Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are common among heart failure patients, and though the systematic circulation is well supported in patients on mechanical circulatory support, these arrhythmias can still be the cause of detrimental symptoms and lead to potentially fatal outcomes. Several studies have shown that mortality rates in LVAD recipients secondary to lethal arrhythmias are uncommon, and newer generation continuous flow devices particularly seem to support hemodynamic support well. While it is common practice to implant ICDs in patients with LVADs and a history of ventricular arrhythmias, the efficacy behind this practice at preventing sudden death in this population is unknown. In this review, we highlight what is already known about the complications, management and treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with LVAD devices.",success

Most of the identified studies were case reports or small case series. Of these, 11 (34.4%) included patients who received chest compressions. A number of studies reported upon delays in the application of chest compressions resulting from complexity due to the expected pulselessness in some patients with continuous flow left-ventricular assist devices as well as from concern regarding potential dislodgement of the mechanical circulatory support device. Three observational studies identified worse outcomes in durable mechanical circulatory support receiving patients with cardiac arrest and acutely impaired perfusion who received chest compressions as compared to those who did not, however those studies were at high risk of bias. Of 226 patients across 11 studies and two published scientific abstracts who sustained cardiac arrest while supported by durable MCS and underwent chest compressions, there were no reported instances of device dislodgement and 71 (31.4%) patients had favorable outcomes. There is a scarcity of evidence to inform the resuscitation of patients with durable mechanical circulatory support (MCS) experiencing acute impairment in perfusion and cardiac arrest.

Healthy non-pregnant women, pregnant women at 20th week of gestation and at 32nd week of gestation without history of cardiac disease were recruited to the study and underwent CMR in supine and left lateral positions. Cardiac hemodynamic parameters and dimensions were measured and compared between both positions. Five non-pregnant women, 6 healthy pregnant women at mid pregnancy and 8 healthy pregnant women at late pregnancy were enrolled in the study.

A manikin with an abdominal model overlay was used for simulated cesarean delivery. The scenario began in the labor room with maternal cardiopulmonary arrest and fetal bradycardia. The primary outcome was time to incision. Secondary outcomes included times to important milestones, percentage of tasks completed, and type of incision.

Fifty-seven percent of labor room teams and 14% of operating room teams achieved delivery within 5 minutes. Contacting the neonatal team, placing the defibrillator, resuming compressions after analysis, and endotracheal intubation all occurred more rapidly in the labor room group. Perimortem cesarean delivery performed in the labor room was significantly faster than perimortem cesarean delivery performed after moving to the operating room. Delivery within 5 minutes was challenging in either location despite optimal study conditions (eg, the manikin was light and easily moved; teams knew the scenario mandated perimortem cesarean delivery and were aware of being timed).

Recently, its incidence has been increasing worldwide because more pregnant women have risk factors. The provision of early, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) plays a major role in the increased likelihood of survival; therefore, it is important for clinicians to know how to manage it. Due to the aortocaval compression caused by the gravid uterus, clinical guidelines often emphasise the importance of maternal positioning during CPR, but there has been little evidence regarding which position is most effective. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, and OpenGrey (updated on April 3, 2021). We included clinical trials and observational studies with reported outcomes related to successful resuscitations. We included eight studies from the 1,490 screened. The eight studies were simulation-based, crossover trials that examine the quality of chest compressions. No data were available about the survival rates of mothers or foetuses/neonates. The meta-analyses showed that resuscitation of pregnant women in the 27°-30° left-lateral tilt position resulted in lower quality chest compressions. The difference is an 19% and 9% reduction in correct compression depth rate and correct hand position rate, respectively, compared with resuscitations in the supine position. Inexperienced clinicians find it difficult to perform chest compressions in the left-lateral tilt position. Given that manual left uterine displacement allows the patient to remain supine, the resuscitation of women in the supine position using manual left uterine displacement should continue to be supported.

The BLS-MS (performed by certified rescuers) served to evaluate the quality of chest compressions in 30° left lateral tilt (LLT) and supine positions. Based on a 5-point scale, each rescuer subjectively graded their experience. The PEA-FM model was used to compare coronary perfusion pressure readings during CPR in supine, supine with left uterine displacement, 30° LLT, and 30° right lateral tilt positions. Compression rate and correctness of hand position, compression depth, and recoil were measures of compression quality (BLS-MS). Compared with LLT position, supine position enabled correct hand position (rate: 0.99 vs 0.88; p<0.05) and compression depth (rate: 0.76 vs 0.36; p<0.001) significantly more often.

Comparison of delivery of a radionuclide given using superior and inferior vena caval access sites was made during normal blood flow and during CPR. Mean times from injection to peak emission count in each ventricle were determined. There were no significant differences between mean peak times for SVC or IVC routes during normal flow or CPR. When peak times were corrected for variations in cardiac output, there were no significant differences between IVC and SVC peak times during normal flow. During CPR, however, mean left ventricular peak time, when corrected for cardiac output, was significantly shorter (P less than .05) when the SVC route was used. The mean time for the counts to reach half the ventricular peak was statistically shorter (P less than .05) in both ventricles with the SVC route during the low flow of CPR. This suggests that during CPR, increased drug dispersion may occur when drugs are infused by the IVC route and thus may modify the anticipated effect of the drug bolus.

Due to proximity to the heart and differential flow rates, the anatomical site of IO access may impact patient outcomes. Using a large dataset, we aimed to compare the outcomes of OHCA patients who received upper or lower extremity IO access during resuscitation. The ESO Data Collaborative public use research datasets were used for this retrospective study. All adult (≥18 years of age) OHCA patients with successful IO access in an upper or lower extremity were evaluated for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had intravenous (IV) access prior to IO access, or if they had a Do Not Resuscitate order documented. Our primary outcome was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcomes included survival to discharge and survival to discharge to home. Mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, etiology, witnessed status, pre-first responder cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), initial electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm, location [private/residential, public, or assisted living/institutional], and response time in addition to the primary airway management strategy (endotracheal intubation, supraglottic device, surgical airway, no advanced airway) were used to compare the outcomes of patients with upper extremity IO access to the outcomes of patients with lower extremity IO access. After application of exclusion criteria, 155,884 patients who received IO access during resuscitation remained (76% lower extremity, 24% upper extremity). Upper extremity IO access was associated with greater adjusted odds of ROSC (1.11 [1.08, 1.15]), and this finding was consistent across multiple patient subgroups. Secondary analyses suggested that upper extremity access was associated with increased survival to discharge (1.18 [1.00, 1.39]) and survival to discharge to home (1.23 [1.02, 1.48]) in comparison to lower extremity IO access. In this large prehospital dataset, upper extremity IO access was associated with a small increase in the odds of ROSC in comparison to lower extremity IO access.

We conducted a randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of initial attempts at intraosseous or intravenous vascular access in adults who had nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was a sustained return of spontaneous circulation. Key secondary outcomes were survival at 30 days and survival at 30 days with a favorable neurologic outcome, defined by a score of 0 to 3 on the modified Rankin scale (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability). Among 1506 patients who underwent randomization, 1479 were included in the primary analysis (731 in the intraosseous-access group and 748 in the intravenous-access group). The successful establishment of vascular access within two attempts occurred in 669 patients (92%) assigned to the intraosseous-access group and in 595 patients (80%) assigned to the intravenous-access group.

This systematic review aimed to quantify maternal adverse effects attributed to treatment, assess how adverse effects vary according to different regimens, and explore women's experiences with this treatment. Bibliographic databases were searched from their inceptions to July 2012 for studies of any design that reported on maternal adverse effects associated with antenatal magnesium sulphate given to improve maternal or infant outcomes. Primary outcomes were life-threatening adverse effects of treatment (death, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest). For randomised controlled trials, data were meta-analysed, and risk ratios (RR) pooled using fixed-effects or random-effects models. For non-randomised studies, data were tabulated by design, and presented as RR, odds ratios or percentages, and summarised narratively. A total of 143 publications were included (21 randomised trials, 15 non-randomised comparative studies, 32 case series and 75 reports of individual cases), of mixed methodological quality. Compared with placebo or no treatment, magnesium sulphate was not associated with an increased risk of maternal death, cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest. Magnesium sulphate significantly increased the risk of 'any adverse effects' overall (RR 4.62, 95% CI 2.42-8.83; 4 trials, 13,322 women), and treatment cessation due to adverse effects (RR 2.77; 95% CI 2.32-3.30; 5 trials, 13,666 women). Few subgroup differences were observed (between indications for use and treatment regimens). In one trial, a lower dose regimen (2 g/3 hours) compared with a higher dose regimen (5 g/4 hours) significantly reduced treatment cessation (RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.01-0.39, 126 women). Adverse effect estimates from studies of other designs largely supported data from randomised trials. Case reports supported an association between iatrogenic overdose of magnesium sulphate and life-threatening consequences. Appropriate administration of antenatal magnesium sulphate was not shown to be associated with serious maternal adverse effects, though an increase in 'minor' adverse effects and treatment cessation was shown. Larger trials are needed to determine optimal regimens, achieving maximal effectiveness with minimal adverse effects, for each antenatal indication for use.

To date, there are a total of two randomized controlled trials on TEG/ROTEM use in obstetrics. ROTEM may be used to guide transfusion therapy for postpartum hemorrhage. TEG and ROTEM can detect the hypercoagulable changes associated with pregnancy. Variability between study protocols and results suggests the need for future large prospective high-quality studies with standardized protocols to investigate the utility of TEG/ROTEM in assessing risk for thrombosis and hemorrhage as well as in guiding prophylaxis and treatment in obstetric patients.

35392980,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare but often catastrophic complication of pregnancy that leads to cardiopulmonary dysfunction and severe disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Although few case reports have reported successful use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) with AFE, concerns can be raised about the increased bleeding risks with that device. This study included patients with AFE rescued by VA-ECMO hospitalized in two high ECMO volume centers between August 2008 and February 2021. Clinical characteristics, critical care management, in-intensive care unit (ICU) complications, and hospital outcomes were collected. ICU survivors were assessed for health-related quality of life (HRQL) in May 2021. During that 13-year study period, VA-ECMO was initiated in 54 parturient women in two high ECMO volume centers. Among that population, 10 patients with AFE [median (range) age 33 (24-40), SAPS II at 69 (56-81)] who fulfilled our diagnosis criteria were treated with VA-ECMO. Pregnancy evolved for 36 (30-41) weeks. Seven patients had a cardiac arrest before ECMO and two were cannulated under cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Pre-ECMO hemodynamic was severely impaired with an inotrope score at 370 (55-1530) μg/kg/min, a severe left ventricular ejection fraction measured at 14 (0-40)%, and lactate at 12 (2-30) mmol/L. 70% of these patients were alive at hospital discharge despite an extreme pre-ECMO severity and massive blood product transfusion. However, HRQL was lower than age-matched controls and still profoundly impaired in the role-physical, bodily pain, and general health components after a median of 44 months follow-up. In this rare per-delivery complication, our results support the use of VA-ECMO despite intense DIC and ongoing bleeding.

We report the case of a patient with AFE requiring massive blood transfusion, rescued using VA-ECMO without initial anticoagulation. A 39-year-old pregnant patient was admitted with a complaint of abdominal pain. An emergency cesarean section was performed because a sudden decrease in fetal heart rate was detected in addition to DIC with hyperfibrinolysis. Intra- and post-operatively, the patient had a bleeding tendency and required massive blood transfusions. After surgery, the patient developed lethal respiratory and circulatory failure, and VA-ECMO was introduced. Based on the course of the illness and imaging findings, the patient was diagnosed with AFE. By controlling the bleeding tendency with a massive transfusion and tranexamic acid administration, using an antithrombotic ECMO circuit, and delaying the initiation of anticoagulation and anti-DIC medication until the bleeding tendency settled, the patient was managed safely on ECMO without complications. By day 5, both respiration and circulation were stable, and the patient was weaned off VA-ECMO. Mechanical ventilation was discontinued on day 6. Finally, she was discharged home without sequelae. VA-ECMO may be effective to save the lives of patients who have AFE with lethal circulatory and respiratory failure. For safe management without bleeding complications, it is important to start VA-ECMO without initial anticoagulants and to administer anticoagulants and anti-DIC drugs after the bleeding tendency has resolved.",success

Maternal morbidity is approximately 50% with the greatest risk of death being in the peripartum period. Pharmacologic therapy to relieve worsening pulmonary hypertension is confounded by the undesired effects of vasodilators on the systemic circulation. Therapy with a specific pulmonary vasodilator, nitric oxide, was attempted.

Administration of nitric oxide was followed by improved oxygenation and lowering of pulmonary artery pressures. A brief episode of methemoglobinemia responded to lowering of the nitric oxide concentration and administration of intravenous methylene blue. Nitric oxide was discontinued after 48 hours. The patient died 2 days later despite continued vasodilator therapy including intra-pulmonary artery prostacyclin. Inhaled nitric oxide can be used to correct the hypoxemia of Eisenmenger syndrome.

Progressive RV dysfunction in these disease states is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide guidance on the assessment and management of RHF. The writing group used systematic literature reviews, published translational and clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion/statements to summarize existing evidence and to identify areas of inadequacy requiring future research. The panel reviewed the most relevant adult medical literature excluding routine laboratory tests using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through September 2017. The document is organized and classified according to the American Heart Association to provide specific suggestions, considerations, or reference to contemporary clinical practice recommendations. Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output and progressive end-organ damage (caused by a combination of end-organ venous congestion and underperfusion), and cachexia resulting from poor absorption of nutrients, as well as a systemic proinflammatory state. It is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Similarly, acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients presenting with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by its complex geometry. Multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making. Pharmacological and mechanical interventions targeting isolated acute and chronic RHF have not been well investigated. Specific therapies promoting stabilization and recovery of RV function are lacking. RHF is a complex syndrome including diverse causes, pathways, and pathological processes. In this scientific statement, we review the causes and epidemiology of RV dysfunction and the pathophysiology of acute and chronic RHF and provide guidance for the management of the associated conditions leading to and caused by RHF.",success

Physiological disturbance may be minimal, but often cardiac output decreases as the right ventricle attempts to overcome increased afterload. Additionally, ventilation-perfusion mismatches can develop in affected vascular beds, reducing systemic oxygenation. Incidence is reported at 50-75 per 100 000 in Australia and New Zealand, with 30-day mortality rates ranging from 0.5% to over 20%. Incidence is likely to increase with the ageing population, increased survival of patients with comorbidities that are considered risk factors and improving sensitivity of imaging techniques. Use of clinical prediction scores, such as the Wells score, has assisted in clinical decision-making and decreased unnecessary radiological investigations. However, imaging (i.e. computed tomography pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scans) is still necessary for objective diagnosis. Anti-coagulation remains the foundation of PE management. Haemodynamically unstable patients require thrombolysis unless absolutely contraindicated, while stable patients with right ventricular dysfunction or ischaemia should be aggressively anti-coagulated. Stable patients with no right ventricular dysfunction can be discharged home early with anti-coagulation and review. However, treatment should be case dependent with full consideration of the patient's clinical state. Direct oral anti-coagulants have become an alternative to vitamin K antagonists and are facilitating shorter hospital admissions. Additionally, duration of anti-coagulation must be decided by considering any provoking factors, bleeding risk and comorbid state. Patients with truly unprovoked or idiopathic PE often require indefinite treatment, while in provoked cases it is typically 3 months with some patients requiring longer periods of 6-12 months.",success

About 183 out of 301 patients (61%) survived to discharge. Patients (n = 51) who received systemic thrombolysis prior to cannulation had similar survival compared with patients who did not (67% vs 61%, respectively; p = 0.48). There was no significant difference in risk of death if PE was the primary reason for admission or not (odds ratio, 1.62; p = 0.35) and if extracorporeal membranous oxygenation cannulation occurred in the emergency department versus other hospital locations (odds ratio, 2.52; p = 0.16). About 53 of 60 patients (88%) were neurologically intact at discharge or follow-up. Multivariate analysis demonstrated three-fold increase in the risk of death for patients greater than 65 years old (adjusted odds ratio, 3.08; p = 0.03) and six-fold increase if cannulation occurred during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (adjusted odds ratio, 5.67; p = 0.03). Venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation has an emerging role in the management of massive PE-related cardiac arrest with 61% survival. Systemic thrombolysis preceding venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation did not confer a statistically significant increase in risk of death, yet age greater than 65 and cannulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation were associated with a three- and six-fold risks of death, respectively.",success

The primary support for massive PE consists of VA; however, VV support can be applied as well in selected cases as this work demonstrates. In the VA group, more patients (38 vs. 83%, P = 0.001) required mechanical resuscitation whereas in the VV group a more aggressive ventilation before support was noted (e.g. minute ventilation: VA=8.8 ± 3.7 L/min, VV=11.5 ± 4.5 L/min, P = 0.01). Survival to discharge was similar in VV and VA patients (45 vs. 48%, P = 0.9). Patients who received additional therapeutic interventions after stabilization with ECMO - e.g. surgical thrombectomy - displayed a similar survival compared with those being only anticoagulated (44% vs. 49%, P = 0.40).

One hundred and nineteen patients with acute PE and severe cardiogenic shock or in need of mechanical resuscitation (CPR) received venoarterial or venovenous ECMO from 2007 to 2020. Long-term data were obtained from survivors by phone contact and personal interviews. Follow-up included a QoL analysis using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, echocardiography, pulmonary function testing and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

Exclusion criteria were sudden death without radiological or pathological pulmonary embolism confirmation and non-thromboembolic pulmonary embolism. The primary outcome was a composite of unfavourable outcomes of pulmonary embolism-related death and pulmonary embolism recurrence or progression. Potential predictors of the composite unfavourable outcome (ie, age at pulmonary embolism diagnosis, sex, underlying cardiac disease, severity of the pulmonary embolism, presence of a central venous catheter, associated venous thromboembolism, family history of thrombosis, treatment modalities, thrombophilia, obesity, and recent surgery) were explored with logistic regression. We calculated pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) and simplified PESI (sPESI) using age-adjusted parameters; we estimated the ability of PESI and sPESI to predict mortality using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Of the 170 patients included, 37 (22%) had massive, 12 (7%) submassive, and 121 (71%) non-massive pulmonary embolism. Patients with massive or submassive pulmonary embolism were younger (median age 12·5 years [IQR 0·6-15·1] vs 14·4 years [9·3-16·1], p<0·0001), more likely to have a cardiac condition (16 [33%] vs 17 [14%] patients, p=0·009), and had more central venous catheters (29 [59%] vs 48 [40%] patients, p=0·027) than patients with non-massive pulmonary embolism.

Amitriptyline (1 mg/kg/min) associated with midazolam (1 mg/kg + 1 mg/kg/h) was infused in 12 of the dogs. Midazolam was replaced by saline in the other 12. Drug administration was continued until signs of cardiotoxicity (QRS prolongation greater than 120 milliseconds or sustained arrhythmias) occurred. At that moment, midazolam effects were suddenly reversed by administration of flumazenil 0.2 mg/kg in six dogs out of each group. Placebo was administered in the others. Reactions were observed for the next 120 minutes. Midazolam-induced sedation efficiently protects (P less than .02) against seizures due to amitriptyline toxicity. This protective effect is counteracted by flumazenil. Midazolam has limited influence on the cardiac toxic effects of amitriptyline. The bolus of flumazenil is, however, associated with a significant worsening of electrocardiogram disturbances, and two sudden deaths were recorded. The mechanism of this effect remains unclear, as it could be unrelated to the antagonization of midazolam sedation. Given the problem of extrapolating animal data to humans, these results suggest that bolus administration of high doses of flumazenil in mixed intoxication implicating benzodiazepine and cyclic antidepressants has the potential to precipitate convulsions and/or arrhythmias.

15898828,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Calcium channel blockers (CCB) and beta-blockers (BB) account for approximately 40% of cardiovascular drug exposures reported to the American Association of Poison Centers. However, these drugs represent >65% of deaths from cardiovascular medications. Yet, caring for patients poisoned with these medications can be extremely difficult. Severely poisoned patients may have profound bradycardia and hypotension that is refractory to standard medications used for circulatory support.Calcium plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular function. The flow of calcium across cell membranes is necessary for cardiac automaticity, conduction and contraction, as well as maintenance of vascular tone. Through differing mechanisms, CCB and BB interfere with calcium fluxes across cell membranes. CCB directly block calcium flow through L-type calcium channels found in the heart, vasculature and pancreas, whereas BB decrease calcium flow by modifying the channels via second messenger systems. Interruption of calcium fluxes leads to decreased intracellular calcium producing cardiovascular dysfunction that, in the most severe situations, results in cardiovascular collapse.Although, CCB and BB have different mechanisms of action, their physiological and toxic effects are similar. However, differences exist between these drug classes and between drugs in each class. Diltiazem and especially verapamil tend to produce the most hypotension, bradycardia, conduction disturbances and deaths of the CCB. Nifedipine and other dihydropyridines are generally less lethal and tend to produce sinus tachycardia instead of bradycardia with fewer conduction disturbances.BB have a wider array of properties influencing their toxicity compared with CCB. BB possessing membrane stabilising activity are associated with the largest proportion of fatalities from BB overdose. Sotalol overdoses, in addition to bradycardia and hypotension, can cause torsade de pointes. Although BB and CCB poisoning can present in a similar fashion with hypotension and bradycardia, CCB toxicity is often associated with significant hyperglycaemia and acidosis because of complex metabolic derangements related to these medications. Despite differences, treatment of poisoning is nearly identical for BB and CCB, with some additional considerations given to specific BB. Initial management of critically ill patients consists of supporting airway, breathing and circulation. However, maintenance of adequate circulation in poisoned patients often requires a multitude of simultaneous therapies including intravenous fluids, vasopressors, calcium, glucagon, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, high-dose insulin, a relatively new therapy, and mechanical devices. This article provides a detailed review of the pharmacology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and treatment strategies for CCB and BB overdoses.",success

In this study, we aimed to answer the question, ""Is hypoglycemia more commonly observed in BB intoxications than in other intoxications?"" This was a case-control study conducted in a pediatric emergency department of a university hospital. The case group (Group 1) consisted of cases with BB poisonings and the control group (Group 2) consisted of cases with selective serotonin receptor inhibitor (SSRI) poisonings. Data were obtained from patient files. We recorded the blood glucose levels (BGLs) of all patients on admission to the emergency department and at the 1-, 6-, and 24-h follow-up. The amounts of BBs received by the cases were compared with the specific toxic doses of each drug. The data obtained were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 22 (SPSS.22) program. Mean and standard deviation for numerical values and frequency for categorical data are reported; at test, chi-square test, and ANOVA tests were used for the analysis.

One possible explanation is that atenolol is less effective in reducing central aortic pressure. Newer vasodilating beta-blockers may prove more effective in reducing central pressure and cardiovascular events. Carvedilol and labetalol appear to cause vasodilation through alpha(1)-receptor blockade; nebivolol induces endothelium-dependent vasodilation by stimulating nitric oxide bioactivity. Their favorable hemodynamic profile includes reduction of peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) while maintaining or improving cardiac output (CO), stroke volume, and left ventricular function, whereas nonvasodilating beta-blockers tend to raise PVR and reduce CO and left ventricular function. Compared with conventional beta-blockers, vasodilating beta-blockers have beneficial hemodynamic effects including decreased pressure wave reflection from the periphery, leading to decreases in central aortic blood pressure. Larger trials are needed to determine whether reduced central pressure will translate into improved CV outcomes compared with nonvasodilating beta-blockers.",success

The search strategy identified 15, 553 citations. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts prior to selecting 141 articles (Kappa on articles included = 0.982, 95% CI 0.980-0.985). Primary outcomes included mortality and improvement in haemodynamic parameters (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure or a composite measure able to quantitate a haemodynamic response).<b>Results:</b> The risk of bias was high for all interventions.<b>Gastric decontamination:</b> Fifteen case reports described the administration of activated charcoal and five detailed the use of gastric lavage. As there was concurrent utilisation of multiple interventions, it was difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the relative contribution of these interventions to mortality or survival.<b>Catecholamines, inotropes and vasopressors:</b> The use of catecholamines in treating beta-blocker toxicity was reported in 16 case reports, 3 case series and 2 animal studies. These agents most likely provided a survival benefit and improved haemodynamics.<b>Atropine:</b> Multiple intravenous boluses of atropine were associated with improvement in heart rate and blood pressure in one case report.<b>Calcium:</b> Intravenous calcium was associated with an improvement in haemodynamics in three out of six case reports but in association with multiple other therapies as well as in two animal studies.<b>High-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy:</b> The use of this therapy was associated with mortality benefit in 10 case series. Two case reports showed clear haemodynamic improvement in a timeframe consistent with insulin administration (bolus then continuous infusion). Maintenance dosing ranged from 1 to 10 units/kg/h of insulin. However, it is unclear whether high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy improved haemodynamic response above catecholamines and other inotropic agents in humans. Hypoglycaemia and hypokalemia were commonly observed adverse effects.<b>Glucagon:</b> Glucagon was associated with minor improvements in haemodynamics through an increase in heart rate in two cases series, nine case reports and five animal studies.<b>Methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue):</b> Four case reports reported an association with improvement in haemodynamics following administration of methylene blue but in the setting of co-ingestion with amlodipine.<b>Intravenous lipid emulsion therapy:</b> There was variable response to intravenous lipid emulsion therapy reported in 10 case series, 5 animal studies and 21 case reports.<b>Lignocaine:</b> There were four case reports showing variable response to lignocaine in arrhythmias secondary to beta-blocker toxicity.<b>Other treatments:</b> Fructose diphosphate, levosimendan and amrinone did not provide a mortality or significant haemodynamic benefit in three animal studies and nine case reports. .<b>Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation:</b> Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was associated with improved survival in patients with severe cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest in an observational study and four cases series.<b>Dialysis:</b> The evidence of four case reports suggest haemodialysis may assist in the management of massive overdose of specific water-soluble beta-blockers (e.g., atenolol) by improving elimination; however, a survival or haemodynamic benefit was not established.<b>Pacing:</b> One case series and a single case report showed the utility of temporary overdrive cardiac pacing to prevent arrhythmias in sotalol toxicity.<b>Conclusions:</b> Catecholamines, vasopressors, high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were associated with reduced mortality. However, it must be acknowledged that multiple treatments were often given simultaneously. Haemodynamic improvements in blood pressure and cardiac output were seen with the use of catecholamines, vasopressin and high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy. Evidence for treatment recommendations is almost entirely drawn from very low- to low-quality studies and subject to bias. However, it is reasonable to have a graduated response to cardiovascular instability beginning with intravenous fluids, commencement of a single or a combination of catecholamine inotropes and vasopressors depending upon the type of haemodynamic compromise (bradycardia, left ventricular dysfunction, vasodilation). High-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy can be introduced as an adjunctive inotrope and lastly, more invasive methods such as veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered in cases unresponsive to other therapies.",success

This is an observational consecutive case series of patients identified from a registry. Data were collected by retrospective chart review of patients treated by our toxicology service with this protocol from February 2007 until March 2010. Twelve patients were treated with high-dose insulin. The mean age was 36.5 years (SD 11.7). Seven patients had pre-existing vasopressor therapy, and all were tapered off vasopressors while on insulin. Two patients experienced pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest prior to high-dose insulin therapy. Intravenous fat emulsion was given to two patients. The mean maximum insulin infusion rate was 8.35 U/kg/h (mean = 8.35, SD 6.34). The mean duration of insulin infusion was 23.5 h (SD 19.7).

Demographics, toxin(s) ingested, clinical effects, investigations (serum glucose, electrolytes), treatments (insulin, glucose, electrolyte replacement), length of stay (LOS) and outcomes were extracted from the patients' medical records. Associations between insulin and glucose/electrolyte homeostasis were explored by comparing insulin administration and glucose or electrolyte concentrations and replacement. There were 22 patients (12 females), median age 57 years (15-88 years) treated with HIE. There were 12 beta-blocker, six calcium channel blocker and three combined beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker ingestions.

In 7 patients, hypoglycaemia was mild (2.5-3.4 mmol/L or 45-62 mg/dl) and in nine was severe (<2.5 mmol/L or <45 mg/dl). There were no neurological effects from hypoglycaemia. A total of 18 patients (82%) developed hypokalaemia (<3.5 mEq/L). In 16 patients, this was mild (2.5-3.4 mEq/L). There were no cardiac arrhythmias associated with this hypokalaemia. There was no apparent association between insulin dosing and severity of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia, or in glucose or potassium replacement. Median insulin loading dose was 80U (range 50-125 U) and the median maximum insulin infusion rate was 150 U/h (range 38-1500 U/h). Median glucose infusions rates were 37.5g/h (range 4-75g/h). There was no apparent association between insulin and glucose administration. Glucose was administered for a median of 18h after ceasing insulin. The duration of glucose administration after ceasing insulin increased with the rate and total insulin administered during HIE. Despite the benefits of HIE in toxin-induced cardiac toxicity, it caused significant disruption to glucose and electrolyte homeostasis, although there were no apparent complications from this.

On individual days, esmolol/saline was infused from -15 to 30 minutes. Glucagon/saline was administered from 0 minutes as a 2-minute intravenous bolus or as a 30-minute infusion (same total glucagon dose). End points were hemodynamic and adverse effects of glucagon compared with saline. Compared with saline, glucagon bolus increased mean heart rate by 13.0 beats per minute (95% CI, 8.0-18.0; <i>P</i><0.001), systolic blood pressure by 15.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 8.0-23.2; <i>P</i>=0.002), diastolic blood pressure by 9.4 mm Hg (95% CI, 6.3-12.6; <i>P</i><0.001), and cardiac output by 18.0 % (95% CI, 9.7-26.9; <i>P</i>=0.003) at the 5-minute time point on days without beta-blockade. Similar effects of glucagon bolus occurred on days with beta-blockade and between 15 and 30 minutes during infusion. Hemodynamic effects of glucagon thus reflected pharmacologic glucagon plasma concentrations. Glucagon-induced nausea occurred in 80% of participants despite ondansetron pretreatment.

Median age was 48years (range 14-89); 50% were male. Eighty-eight patients (44%) were poisoned by BBs, 66 (33%) by CCBs, and 45 (23%) by both. Median nadir pulse was 54 beats/min (range 12-121); median nadir systolic blood pressure was 70mmHg (range, 30-167). Forty-one patients (21%) experienced cardiac arrest; 31 (16%) died. Median insulin bolus was 1U/kg (range, 0.5-10). Median starting insulin infusion was 1U/kg/h (range 0.22-10); median peak infusion was 8U/kg/h (range 0.5-18). Hypokalemia occurred in 29% of patients. Hypoglycemia occurred in 31% of patients; 50% (29/50) experienced hypoglycemia when dextrose infusion concentration ≤10%, and 30% (31/105) experienced hypoglycemia when dextrose infusion concentration ≥20%.

Following a systematic review of the literature, data were summarized in four publications: LA and non-LA poisoning efficacy, adverse effects, and analytical interferences. Twenty-two toxins or toxin categories and three clinical situations were selected for voting. Voting statements were proposed using a predetermined format. A two-round modified Delphi method was used to reach consensus on the voting statements. Disagreement was quantified using RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. For the management of cardiac arrest, we recommend using ILE with bupivacaine toxicity, while our recommendations are neutral regarding its use for all other toxins. For the management of life-threatening toxicity, (1) as first line therapy, we suggest not to use ILE with toxicity from amitriptyline, non-lipid soluble beta receptor antagonists, bupropion, calcium channel blockers, cocaine, diphenhydramine, lamotrigine, malathion but are neutral for other toxins, (2) as part of treatment modalities, we suggest using ILE in bupivacaine toxicity if other therapies fail, but are neutral for other toxins, (3) if other therapies fail, we recommend ILE for bupivacaine toxicity and we suggest using ILE for toxicity due to other LAs, amitriptyline, and bupropion, but our recommendations are neutral for all other toxins. In the treatment of non-life-threatening toxicity, recommendations are variable according to the balance of expected risks and benefits for each toxin.

Coronary microvessels were isolated from the heart of normal dogs and incubated with increasing doses of the calcium channel blockers nifedipine, diltiazem, and amlodipine or the ACE inhibitors enalaprilat and ramiprilat. Neither nifedipine nor diltiazem increased nitrite production at any dose studied.

Amlodipine also increased nitrite production in large coronary arteries and in aorta. N(omega)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, HOE-140, and dichloroisocoumarin essentially abolished the increase in nitrite production, indicating that (1) nitrite production reflected NO formation, (2) nitrite production was dependent on stimulation of the kinin2 receptor, and (3) nitrite production is most likely secondary to the formation of local kinins.

HDI causes vasodilation by stimulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Most literature supporting HDI for CCB poisoning involves verapamil toxicity; however, amlodipine now causes more CCB poisonings. Unlike other CCBs, amlodipine stimulates eNOS and may cause synergistic vasodilation with HDI. The purpose of this study was to determine if amlodipine-poisoned patients treated with HDI had more evidence of vasodilation than similarly treated patients with non-dihydropyridine (non-DHP) poisoning.<b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective study from a single poison center. Cases were identified via the generic code ""Calcium Antagonists"" in which the therapy ""High Dose Insulin/Glucose"" was ""performed, whether or not recommended"" from 2019-2021. Evidence of vasodilation was assessed via maximum number of vasopressor infusions per case, vasopressor doses, and use of rescue methylene blue to treat refractory vasoplegia.<b>Results:</b> Thirty-three patients were enrolled: 18 poisoned with amlodipine, 15 with non-DHPs (verapamil <i>n</i> = 10, diltiazem <i>n</i> = 5). The median number of maximum concomitant vasopressors in the amlodipine group was 3 (IQR: 2-5; range 0-6) and 2 in the non-DHP group (IQR: 1-3; range 0-5; <i>p</i> = 0.04); median difference in maximum concomitant vasopressors between groups was 1 (95% confidence interval: 0-2).

Maximal vasopressor infusion doses were epinephrine 150 μg/minute, dopamine 100 μg/kg per minute, dobutamine 245 μg/kg per minute, isoproterenol 60 μg/minute, phenylephrine 250 μg/minute, and norepinephrine 100 μg/minute. The use of multiple vasopressors was common. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemia was used in 3 patients who also received multiple vasopressors. Eight probable or possible ischemic complications were noted in 5 of 48 (10%) patients. Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 3 of 48 (6%) patients; a brain magnetic resonance imaging in 1 patient suggested mild ischemia, without clinical evidence of infarction; 1 patient had ischemic bowel; and 3 patients developed renal failure from acute tubular necrosis, which resolved in each case. Six of the 8 ischemic complications were evident before use of vasopressor therapy. Three patients sustained inhospital cardiac arrest before admission and were successfully resuscitated. Each of these arrests occurred before instituting vasopressor infusions. One patient experienced a late cardiac arrest from primary respiratory arrest from administration of sedatives, and multiple organ system failure followed resuscitation, with death occurring during manipulation of a pulmonary artery catheter. The remaining 47 patients recovered. There were 12 patients in the group of additional poisoned patients for whom results of urine drug screening were unavailable. Four patients were treated with vasopressors, 2 experienced acute tubular necrosis that was present before vasopressor use, and all recovered. In our series of patients admitted with verapamil or diltiazem overdose, hypotension was common and managed with the use of multiple vasopressors and without hyperinsulinemic euglycemia in all but 3 cases. Despite high doses of vasopressors, ischemic complications were the exception and were usually present before use of vasopressors. Death occurred in a single patient whose death was not attributed directly to calcium-channel blocker toxicity. Vasopressor use after verapamil or diltiazem overdose was associated with good clinical outcomes without permanent sequelae.",success

Overall survival was 70% and did not vary significantly over the study period for children or adults. Patients with metabolic and hematologic poisonings were less likely to survive following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than those with other poisonings (49% vs 72%; p = 0.004). The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to support critically ill, poisoned patients in the United States is increasing, driven primarily by increased use in patients greater than 12 years old.

Cocaine has numerous deleterious effects in humans including seizures, vasoconstriction, ischaemia, increased heart rate and blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. The cardiotoxic effects of cocaine are indirectly mediated by an increase in sympathomimetic stimulation to the heart and coronary vasculature and by a direct effect on the ion channels responsible for maintaining the electrical excitability of the heart. The direct and indirect effects of cocaine work in tandem to disrupt the co-ordinated electrical activity of the heart and have been associated with life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

In paced right atrial (RA) and right ventricular papillary (RVP) tissues, cocaine produced a profound prolongation of the effective refractory period (ERP) assessed by either premature stimulation or minimum pacing interval. ERP was increased up to eightfold in RA tissue and doubled in RVP tissue by 60 microM cocaine. This concentration of cocaine depressed action potential phase 0 depolarization 80% in RA tissue and 53% in RVP tissue but had no effect on resting membrane potentials. Automaticity was moderately depressed in sinus node (34% decrease in rate) but not in tricuspid valve cells. Phase 0 depolarization was not altered in these spontaneously active slow-response cells. Repolarization was depressed in RA, tricuspid valve, and sinus node cells leading to a twofold increase in action potential duration during exposure to cocaine.

Other compounds delaying repolarization have proved to be clinically effective as antiarrhythmics. In addition to their class 2 antiarrhythymic action exhibited acutely, on long-term treatment beta blockers have a class 3 action, which might be, at least in part, responsible for the protection of postinfarction patients against sudden death.

8010552,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Psychostimulant drugs such as amphetamines, amphetamine derivatives, and cocaine produce a variety of potentially lethal effects, and an understanding of these toxic effects is important for emergency physicians. While some effects of psychostimulant poisonings such as cardiovascular compromise and seizures have been discussed extensively, other metabolic derangements such as hyperthermia are less well characterized. In fact, hyperthermia is a common feature of severe-to-lethal poisonings and may be the primary mode of demise in some patients. Animal studies confirm that drug-induced hyperthermia alone can be lethal in some species, although other toxic effects may predominate at different drug doses or rates of administration. In non-lethal poisonings, hyperthermia can produce rhabdomyolysis, leading to further morbidity. Clinical reports and animal studies indicate that hyperthermia is a primary effect of psychostimulant drugs and can occur independently of seizures or increased motor activity. Furthermore, activation of particular dopamine receptors in the central nervous system appears to mediate psychostimulant-induced hyperthermia. The literature suggests cooling and tranquilization of psychostimulant-poisoned patients after cardiovascular stabilization. Paralysis and mechanical ventilation may be required. The involvement of dopamine receptor activation in psychostimulant toxicity suggests that dopamine-blocking neuroleptic drugs may be a useful adjunct to current treatment regimens. However, further studies are required to assess this approach. In summary, hyperthermia is a potentially lethal but treatable manifestation of severe psychostimulant poisoning.",success

EC may delay the hypothermia initiation time, and there was no significant difference between the two cooling methods in the time from the start of patients' cardiac arrest to achieve the target temperature (MD = - 46.64[- 175.86, 82.58]). EC was superior to non-ArcticSun in terms of cooling efficiency. Although there was no statistical difference in ICU survival rate, ICU length of stay, and hospitalization survival rate, in comparison to non-ArcticSun, EC improved rates of neurologically intact survival (RR = 1.16 [1.01, 1.35], p = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Among adult patients receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, although there is no significant difference between the two cooling methods in the time from the start of cardiac arrest to achieve the target temperature, the faster cooling rate and more stable cooling process in EC shorten patients' ICU hospitalization time and help more patients obtain good neurological prognosis compared with patients receiving SC. Meanwhile, although EC has no significant difference in patient outcomes compared with ArcticSun, EC has improved rates of neurologically intact survival.",success

During April 2007, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, SportDiscus, CINAHL, and Cochrane Reviews databases as well as ProQuest for theses and dissertations to identify research studies evaluating whole-body cooling treatments without limits. Key words were cooling, cryotherapy, water immersion, cold-water immersion, ice-water immersion, icing, fanning, bath, baths, cooling modality, heat illness, heat illnesses, exertional heatstroke, exertional heat stroke, heat exhaustion, hyperthermia, hyperthermic, hyperpyrexia, exercise, exertion, running, football, military, runners, marathoner, physical activity, marathoning, soccer, and tennis. Two independent reviewers graded each study on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Seven of 89 research articles met all inclusion criteria and a minimum score of 4 out of 10 on the PEDro scale. After an extensive and critical review of the available research on whole-body cooling for the treatment of exertional hyperthermia, we concluded that ice-water immersion provides the most efficient cooling. Further research comparing whole-body cooling modalities is needed to identify other acceptable means. When ice-water immersion is not possible, continual dousing with water combined with fanning the patient is an alternative method until more advanced cooling means can be used. Until future investigators identify other acceptable whole-body cooling modalities for exercise-induced hyperthermia, ice-water immersion and cold-water immersion are the methods proven to have the fastest cooling rates.",success

We conducted this retrospective observational study to compare traditional cooling with endovascular cooling in post-cardiac arrest comatose survivors and to compare results with current guidelines. All patients admitted to our ICU for cardiac arrest and for whom temperature control was performed were included. Traditional cooling included cold infusions, ice packs and cooling blankets. Endovascular cooling consisted in the insertion of a catheter in which cold fluid circulates in a closed circuit provided by a heat exchanger. Temperature control was started at a target temperature of 32°C to 34°C. Rewarming was performed passively in the traditional group and via computer-assistance in endovascular group. We evaluated the delay prior to and speed of cooling, thermic stability during the maintenance phase and the speed of rewarming. Thirty-four patients were included. The speed of cooling was faster with the endovascular (-0.66±0.35°C/h) compared to the traditional (-0.35±0.38°C/h, P=0.006) technique, with target temperatures reached in 4.0 and 6.0h, respectively (P=0.14). Temperatures were more stable with the endovascular technique (0.03±0.05°C2) than with the traditional technique (0.26±0.16°C2, P<10<sup>-4</sup>). There were more deviations from the guideline target range in the traditional group (64.7% versus 17.6%, P=0.008).

Various devices are available to induce and maintain hypothermia, but few studies have compared the performance of these devices. We performed a prospective study to compare four frequently used cooling systems in inducing and maintaining hypothermia followed by controlled rewarming. We performed a prospective multi-centered study in ten ICU's in three hospitals within the UPMC health system. Four different cooling technologies (seven cooling methods in total) were studied: two external water-circulating cooling blankets (Meditherm® and Blanketrol®), gel-coated adhesive cooling pads (Arctic Sun®), and endovascular cooling catheters with balloons circulating ice-cold saline (Thermogard®). For the latter system we studied three different types of catheter with two, three or four water-circulating balloons, respectively. In contrast to previous studies, we not only studied the cooling rate (i.e., time to target temperature) in the induction phase, but also the percentage of the time during the maintenance phase that temperature was on target ±0.5 °C, and the efficacy of devices to control rewarming. We believe that these are more important indicators of device performance than induction speed alone. 129 consecutive patients admitted after CA and treated with hypothermia were screened, and 120 were enrolled in the study. Two researchers dedicated fulltime to this study monitored TH treatment in all patients, including antishivering measures, additional cooling measures used (e.g. icepacks and cold fluid infusion), and all other issues related to temperature management. Baseline characteristics were similar for all groups. Cooling rates were 2.06 ± 1.12 °C/h for endovascular cooling, 1.49 ± 0.82 for Arctic sun, 0.61 ± 0.36 for Meditherm and 1.22 ± 1.12 for Blanketrol. Time within target range ±0.5 °C was 97.3 ± 6.0% for Thermogard, 81.8 ± 25.2% for Arctic Sun, 57.4 ± 29.3% for Meditherm, and 64.5 ± 20.1% for Blanketrol. The following differences were significant: Thermogard vs. Meditherm (p < 0.01), Thermogard vs. Blanketrol (p < 0.01), and Arctic Sun vs. Meditherm (p < 0.02). No major complications occurred with any device. Endovascular cooling and gel-adhesive pads provide more rapid hypothermia induction and more effective temperature maintenance compared to water-circulating cooling blankets.

Optimal procedures for CWI in the field are not well established. This meta-analysis aimed to provide structured analysis of the effectiveness of CWI on the cooling rate in healthy adults subjected to exercise-induced hyperthermia. An electronic search (December 2014) was conducted using the PubMed and Web of Science. The mean difference of the cooling rate between CWI and passive recovery was calculated. Pooled analyses were based on a random-effects model. Sources of heterogeneity were identified through a mixed-effects model Q statistic. Inferential statistics aggregated the CWI cooling rate for extrapolation. Nineteen studies qualified for inclusion. Results demonstrate CWI elicited a significant effect: mean difference, 0.03°C·min(-1); 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.04°C·min(-1). A conservative, observed estimate of the CWI cooling rate was 0.08°C·min(-1) across various conditions. CWI cooled individuals twice as fast as passive recovery. Subgroup analyses revealed that cooling was more effective (Q test P < 0.10) when preimmersion core temperature ≥38.6°C, immersion water temperature ≤10°C, ambient temperature ≥20°C, immersion duration ≤10 min, and using torso plus limbs immersion. There is insufficient evidence of effect using forearms/hands CWI for rapid cooling: mean difference, 0.01°C·min(-1); 95% confidence interval, -0.01°C·min(-1) to 0.04°C·min(-1). A combined data summary, pertaining to 607 subjects from 29 relevant studies, was presented for referencing the weighted cooling rate and recovery time, aiming for practitioners to better plan emergency procedures. An optimal procedure for yielding high cooling rates is proposed. Using prompt vigorous CWI should be encouraged for treating exercise-induced hyperthermia whenever possible, using cold water temperature (approximately 10°C) and maximizing body surface contact (whole-body immersion).",success

We examined the hemodynamic and electrophysiological effects of cocaine administered as a series of 5-mg/kg i.v. boluses coupled with a continuous infusion in anesthetized dogs. Sodium bicarbonate (50 meq i.v.) was administered as a potential antidote in 11 of 15 dogs, and intravenous 5% dextrose was given in the remaining four. In a dose-dependent fashion, cocaine significantly decreased blood pressure, coronary blood flow, and cardiac output; increased PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals and sinus cycle length; and increased ventricular effective refractory period and dispersion of ventricular refractoriness. No afterdepolarizations were noted in the monophasic action potential recording. Nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred spontaneously in two dogs, and sustained ventricular tachycardia could be induced by programmed stimulation at the end of the dosing protocol in five of 11 animals. Sodium bicarbonate promptly decreased cocaine-induced QRS prolongation to nearly that measured at baseline but had no effect on the other electrocardiographic or hemodynamic variables. In one dog, sodium bicarbonate administration was associated with reversion of ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm. We conclude that high-dose cocaine possesses negative inotropic and potent type I electrophysiological effects. Sodium bicarbonate selectively reversed cocaine-induced QRS prolongation and may be a useful treatment of ventricular arrhythmias associated with slowed ventricular conduction in the setting of cocaine overdose.",success

Prospective, controlled, experimental study in which 15 anesthetized dogs were given three successive boluses of cocaine (7 mg/kg) and then randomized to receive NaHCO3, 2 mEq/kg (n = 8) or placebo (n =7). Arterial, left ventricular, and pulmonary artery pressures; cardiac output (CO); electrocardiogram (ECG); blood gases; and serum concentrations of cocaine were measured at baseline, at fixed time intervals after each bolus of cocaine, and then after administration of NaHCO3 or placebo. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Seven dogs experienced significant arrhythmias, including VT, pulseless electrical activity, and third-degree atrioventricular block; 2 of these dogs expired prior to receiving NaHCO3 and were excluded. Immediately after administering NaHCO3, QRS duration decreased by 30% (p < 0.001), returning to baseline more quickly than in the control group. This effect was associated with a brief 30% decrease in MAP (p = NS). After NaHCO3, CO increased 78% and remained increased for 5 min (p < 0.007).

Although the mechanism(s) remain unclear, cocaine-induced block of sodium channels resulting in slowed cardiac conduction is thought to play an important role. Several reports suggest that the effects of cocaine effects on cardiac sodium channels can be reversed by administration of sodium bicarbonate. Whether the beneficial effects of sodium bicarbonate are due to sodium ions or an increase in blood pH is unknown. Therefore the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of sodium loading alone (by using sodium chloride) versus sodium loading with an associated increase in arterial pH (by using sodium bicarbonate) on reversing cocaine-induced effects on the electrocardiogram (ECG) in a canine model. Seventeen anesthetized dogs received three i.v. injections of cocaine, 5 mg/kg, with each dose separated by 15 min. Two minutes after the third cocaine dose, each dog was randomly assigned to receive 2 mEq/kg i.v. sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/ml) or 2 mEq/kg i.v. sodium chloride (1 mEq/ml). ECG, electrophysiologic, and hemodynamic data were recorded at baseline, after each cocaine injection, and after administration of sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride. In both groups of animals, the first cocaine injection significantly (p < 0.05) prolonged the PR, QTc, AH, and HV intervals, and QRS duration compared with baseline. All intervals continued to lengthen in a dose-dependent manner after the second and third cocaine doses. Sodium bicarbonate significantly (p < 0.05) reduced cocaine-induced prolongation of PR [(147 +/- 5-130 +/- 5 ms), AH (81 +/- 6 - 72 +/- 6 ms), and HV intervals (55 +/- 2 - 39 +/- 1 ms). and QRS duration (96 +/- 6 - 66 +/- 4 ms), peak effect after third cocaine dose versus after sodium bicarbonate, respectively]. Sodium chloride had no effect on reversing cocaine-induced effects on the ECG. Cocaine produces dose-dependent slowing of cardiac conduction that is effectively reversed by sodium bicarbonate. The lack of efficacy of sodium chloride suggests that the increase in arterial pH associated with sodium bicarbonate is responsible for reversal of the effects of cocaine on the ECG. Therefore sodium bicarbonate may be clinically useful in the treatment of cocaine-induced cardiac arrhythmias, primarily as a result of its effects on arterial pH.",success

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), OpenGrey, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to November 2015. Articles on pharmacological treatment involving human subjects and cocaine were selected and reviewed. Evidence was graded using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines. Treatment recommendations were compared to current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Special attention was given to adverse drug events or treatment failure. The search resulted in 2376 articles with 120 eligible involving 2358 human subjects. Benzodiazepines and other GABA-active agents: There were five high-quality (CEBM Level I/II) studies, three retrospective (Level III), and 25 case series/reports (Level IV/V) supporting the use of benzodiazepines and other GABA-active agents in 234 subjects with eight treatment failures. Benzodiazepines may not always effectively mitigate tachycardia, hypertension, and vasospasm from cocaine toxicity. Calcium channel blockers: There were seven Level I/II, one Level III, and seven Level IV/V studies involving 107 subjects and one treatment failure. Calcium channel blockers may decrease hypertension and coronary vasospasm, but not necessarily tachycardia. Nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators: There were six Level I/II, one Level III, and 25 Level IV/V studies conducted in 246 subjects with 11 treatment failures and two adverse drug events. Nitroglycerin may lead to severe hypotension and reflex tachycardia. Alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs: There were two Level I studies and three case reports. Alpha-1 blockers may improve hypertension and vasospasm, but not tachycardia, although evidence is limited. Alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonists: There were two high-quality studies and one case report detailing the successful use of dexmedetomidine. Beta-blockers and β/α-blockers: There were nine Level I/II, seven Level III, and 34 Level IV/V studies of β-blockers, with 1744 subjects, seven adverse drug events, and three treatment failures. No adverse events were reported for use of combined β/α-blockers such as labetalol and carvedilol, which were effective in attenuating both hypertension and tachycardia.

IV injection of cocaine was followed by tonic-clonic seizure activity in all treatment groups. No study drug significantly improved survival compared with the placebo group. However, no animal treated with propranolol survived (P less than .05 vs saline control), and only one of ten animals treated with labetalol survived (P = .14 vs placebo group).

Shortly thereafter, the patient complained of crushing substernal chest pain, developed pulseless electrical activity, and could not be resuscitated.

Odds ratios were used to quantify the association between death and diagnosis (ExDS vs. AgDS) across the covariates. There were 61 articles describing 168 cases of ExDS or AgDS, of which 104 (62%) were fatal. ExDS was diagnosed in 120 (71%) cases, and AgDS in 48 (29%). Fatalities were more likely to be diagnosed as ExDS (OR: 9.9, p < 0.0001). Aggressive restraint (i.e. manhandling, handcuffs, and hobble ties) was more common in ExDS (ORs: 4.7, 14, 29.2, respectively, p < 0.0001) and fatal cases (ORs: 7.4, 10.7, 50, respectively, p < 0.0001). Sedation was more common in AgDS and survived cases (OR:11, 25, respectively, p < 0.0001). The results of the study indicate that a diagnosis of ExDS is far more likely to be associated with both aggressive restraint and death, in comparison with AgDS. There is no evidence to support ExDS as a cause of death in the absence of restraint. These findings are at odds with previously published theories indicating that ExDS-related death is due to an occult pathophysiologic process.

26140275,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"This paper reviews milestones in antidotal therapies for cyanide (CN) spanning early remedies, current antidotal systems and research towards next generation therapies. CN has been a part of plant defense mechanisms for millions of years. It became industrially important in the nineteenth century with the advent of CN assisted gold mining and the use of CN as a pest control agent. The biochemical basis of CN poisoning was actively studied and key mechanisms were understood as early as 1929. These fundamental studies led to a variety of antidotes, including indirect CN binders that generate methemoglobin, direct CN binders such as hydroxocobalamin, and sulfur donors that convert CN to the less toxic thiocyanate. Research on blood gases at the end of the twentieth century shed new light on the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the body. The discovery of NO's ability to compete with CN for enzymatic binding sites provided a previously missed explanation for the rapid efficacy of NO generating antidotes such as the nitrites. Presently used CN therapies include: methemoglobin/NO generators (e.g., sodium nitrite, amyl nitrite, and dimethyl aminophenol), sulfur donors (e.g., sodium thiosulfate and glutathione), and direct binding agents [(e.g., hydroxocobalamin and dicobalt salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (dicobalt edetate)]. A strong effort is being made to explore novel antidotal systems and to formulate them for rapid administration at the point of intoxication in mass casualty scenarios. New antidotes, formulations, and delivery systems are enhancing bioavailability and efficacy and hold promise for a new generation of improved CN countermeasures.",success

Pubmed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane were searched from 1946 to May 2013 using the terms digoxin, digoxin-specific Fab, and digoxin antibody. Pharmacology and kinetics of digoxin and digoxin-Fab. Digoxin acts via inhibition of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase. It has a narrow therapeutic index. Digoxin has 60-80% bioavailability, a mean plasma half-life of 40 h and a volume of distribution (Vd) of 5-10 L/kg and low protein binding (20%). A 40-mg vial of digoxin-Fab (DigiFab) binds 0.5 mg digoxin. Digoxin-Fab has a mean plasma half-life of 19-30 h and a Vd of 0.4 L/kg. The half-lives of both digoxin and digoxin-Fab are prolonged in renal failure to over 100 h. Efficacy and effectiveness of digoxin-Fab. There were no randomised clinical trials examining the use of digoxin-Fab for acute or chronic digoxin poisonings. Ten case series with a total of 2,080 patients have reported on the use of digoxin-Fab in digoxin poisoning. In three large case series of 430 acute and 1308 chronic poisonings, response rates to digoxin-Fab vary from 80-90% to 50%. The time for reversal of digoxin toxicity is reported to be 30-45 min. Studies with pharmacokinetic data showed that free digoxin concentration fell to almost zero within a few minutes following the administration of digoxin-Fab. Digoxin-Fab was used more frequently in acute than chronic digoxin poisoning with a higher reported success rate when used in acute overdose. It is sometimes recommended to use full neutralisation doses (based on serum concentration × Vd or ingested dose). It has also been proposed to use half this dose. Indications for digoxin-Fab. Patients who have life-threatening tachy-bradyarrhythmias, hyperkalaemia (> 6 mmol/L) or haemodynamic instability with an elevated digoxin concentration (> 2 μg/L or 2.6 nmol/L). The lowest effective digoxin-Fab dosing regimen has not been established. Safety of digoxin-Fab. Adverse events such as exacerbation of heart failure, increased ventricular rate and hypokalaemia are uncommon (< 10%). Recrudescence of digoxin toxicity and allergic reactions are infrequent. Digoxin-Fab dosing in acute poisoning. Digoxin load based on ingested dose will generally overestimate digoxin-Fab doses as bioavailability is 60-80%, and further reduced by vomiting and activated charcoal. Digoxin load based on concentration also will be overestimated when the concentration is taken before distribution is complete (around 6 h). Much smaller doses of digoxin-Fab can eliminate the digoxin in the central compartment (Vd ≈ 55 L). In imminent cardiac arrest, it may be justified to give a full neutralising dose. Otherwise, based on pharmacokinetic modelling, it is recommended to give 80 mg bolus digoxin-Fab, repeated as required according to clinical parameters because the onset of clinical response is usually rapid. Most patients would be expected to require a total of less than half of the calculated neutralising dose using this strategy. Digoxin-Fab dosing in chronic poisoning. Even if digoxin load is estimated following distribution (> 6 h), excessive neutralisation doses may still be calculated because of variation in Vd due to equations failing to account for lean body weight, age and renal failure. In practice, it is suggested to give 40 mg (1 vial) digoxin-Fab at a time and repeat after 60 min if patient is still symptomatic, sooner if patient is clinically unstable. In general, 40-120 mg (1-3 vials) should be sufficient. Digoxin-Fab is safe and indicated in all patients with life-threatening arrhythmias and an elevated digoxin concentration. However, calculated full neutralising doses of digoxin-Fab are expensive and may not be required. In acute poisoning, a small bolus of 80 mg, repeat if necessary, titrated against clinical effect, is likely to achieve equivalent benefits with much lower total doses. With chronic poisoning, it may be simplest to give 40 mg (1 vial) digoxin-Fab at a time and repeat after 60 min if there is no response.",success

However, even in the case of those treatments that have been in use for decades, there is debate regarding their efficacy, the indications and dosage that optimizes outcomes. This contributes to variability in use across the world. Another factor influencing usage is access. Barriers to access include the requirement for transfer to a specialized centre (for example, to receive temporary pacing) or financial resources (for example, anti-digoxin Fab in resource poor countries). Recent data suggest that existing methods for calculating the dose of anti-digoxin Fab in digoxin poisoning overstate the dose required, and that its efficacy may be minimal in patients with chronic digoxin poisoning. Cheaper and effective medicines are required, in particular for the treatment of yellow oleander poisoning which is problematic in resource poor countries.",success

The youngest patient received Fab fragments within several hours of birth, and the oldest patient was 94 years old. Seventy-five patients (50%) were receiving long-term digitalis therapy, 15 (10%) had taken a large overdose of digitalis accidentally, and 59 (39%) had ingested an overdose of digitalis with suicidal intent.

Poisoning by these plants is a common toxicological emergency in tropical and subtropical parts of the world and intentional self-harm using T. peruviana is prevalent in South Asian countries, especially India and Sri Lanka. All parts of these plants are toxic, and contain a variety of cardiac glycosides including neriifolin, thevetin A, thevetin B, and oleandrin. Ingestion of either oleander results in nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dysrhythmias, and hyperkalemia. In most cases, clinical management of poisoning by either N. oleander or T. peruviana involves administration of activated charcoal and supportive care. Digoxin specific Fab fragments are an effective treatment of acute intoxication by either species. However, where limited economic resources restrict the use of such Fab fragments, treatment of severely poisoned patients is difficult. Data from case reports and clinical studies were reviewed to identify treatments supported by evidence for the management of poisoning by N. oleander and T. peruviana.",success

Currently, patients must be transferred to the capital for temporary cardiac pacing. We did a randomised controlled trial to investigate whether anti-digoxin Fab could reverse serious oleander-induced arrhythmias. After a preliminary dose-finding study, 66 patients who presented to hospital with a serious cardiac arrhythmia were randomised to receive either 1200 mg of anti-digoxin Fab or a saline placebo. A 12-lead electrocardiogram, 3 min rhythm strip, and blood sample for measurement of electrolytes and cardiac glycosides were taken before treatment and at 12 timepoints thereafter. 34 patients received anti-digoxin Fab and 32 received placebo. The presenting arrhythmia had resolved completely after 2 h in 15 antibody-treated patients and two controls (p<0.001); 24 and five patients, respectively, were in sinus rhythm at 8 h (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to first reversal showed a significant response to anti-digoxin Fab. The heart rate increased in cases, from 49.1 per min at baseline to 66.8 at 2 h, but not in controls (50.6 per min at baseline to 51.5; p<0.001). Mean serum potassium concentrations decreased from 4.9 mmol/L to 4.1 mmol/L at 2 h in cases; no such decrease occurred in controls. Anti-digoxin Fab fragments are a safe and effective treatment for serious cardiac arrhythmias induced by yellow oleander. Their use in small rural hospitals in Sri Lanka should minimise costly transfer of patients and reduce the numbers of deaths; however, further study will be required to confirm this reduction.",success

While poisoning with the digitalis cardenolides (digoxin and digitoxin) are reported worldwide, cardiotoxicity from other cardenolides such as the yellow oleander are also a major problem, with tens of thousands of cases of poisoning each year in South Asia. Because cardenolides from these plants are structurally similar, acute poisonings are managed using similar treatments. The benefit of these treatments is of interest, particularly in the context of cost since most poisonings occur in developing countries where resources are very limited. To determine the efficacy of antidotes for the treatment of acute cardenolide poisoning, in particular atropine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC), fructose-1,6-diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, phenytoin and anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Collaboration, Current Awareness in Clinical Toxicology, Info Trac, www.google.com.au, and Science Citation Index of studies identified by the previous searches. We manually searched the bibliographies of identified articles and personally contacted experts in the field. Randomised controlled trials where antidotes were administered to patients with acute symptomatic cardenolide poisoning were identified. We independently extracted data on study design, including the method of randomisation, participant characteristics, type of intervention and outcomes from each study. We independently assessed methodological quality of the included studies. A pooled analysis was not appropriate. Two randomised controlled trials were identified, both were conducted in patients with yellow oleander poisoning. One trial investigated the effect of MDAC on mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.83) indicating a beneficial effect. The second study found a beneficial effect of anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin on the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias at two hours post-administration; the RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.81). Other benefits were also noted in both studies and serious adverse effects were minimal. Studies assessing the effect of antidotes on other cardenolides were not identified. One ongoing study investigating the activated charcoal for acute yellow oleander self-poisoning was also identified. There is some evidence to suggest that MDAC and anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin may be effective treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. However, the efficacy and indications of these interventions for the treatment of acute digitalis poisoning is uncertain due to the lack of good quality controlled clinical trials. Given pharmacokinetic differences between individual cardenolides, the effect of antidotes administered to patients with yellow oleander poisoning cannot be readily translated to those of other cardenolides. Unfortunately cost limits the use of antidotes such as anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin in developing countries where cardenolide poisonings are frequent.

8387009,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Digitalis glycoside-like properties of the Bufo marinus toad crude venom and one of its constituents, bufalin, were studied in various assay systems. In concentrations 0.3-30 micrograms/ml crude venom increased the contractility of isolated electrically driven rat atria, constricted rat aortic rings, inhibited ouabain-sensitive Na+,K(+)-ATPase in rat erythrocytes and the Na+,K(+)-pump in rat aorta, and cross-reacted with antidigoxin antibody from the dissociation enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmunoassay (DELFIA). These effects were unaffected by adrenoceptor blockers and the 5-HT antagonist, deseril, but were blocked by antidigoxin antibody. Bufalin (10-30 microM) increased myocardial contractility and inhibited Na+,K(+)-ATPase in rat erythrocytes similarly to crude Bufo marinus venom. In rat aorta bufalin showed weak and delayed vasoconstrictor activity which was antagonized by 2 microM phentolamine, and had a biphasic effect on the Na+,K(+)-pump; 0.5-1.0 microM bufalin stimulated the pump, while higher concentrations inhibited its activity. Although the effects of bufalin were blocked by antidigoxin antibody, bufalin showed very low digoxin-like immunoreactivity in the DELFIA. These observations suggest that, in addition to bufalin, Bufo marinus venom contains at least one more digitalis-like steroid with significant intrinsic vasoconstrictor activity which, unlike bufalin, constricts the blood vessels acting directly via inhibition of the sodium pump in the vascular smooth muscle membrane.",success

Deaths have occurred following ingestion of these products and the clinical course resembles digoxin toxicity. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of digoxin specific Fab fragments in treating Chan Su poisoning. An ethanolic extract was prepared from Chan Su. Digoxin specific Fab fragments were reconstituted in normal saline to a concentration of 80 mg/ml. An approximate LD90 dose was determined in preliminary experiments. Mice were then randomly divided into a treatment group of 15 mice and a control group of 30 mice. The treatment group was pretreated with 20 ml/kg of digoxin specific Fab fragment solution by intraperitoneal injection at t = 0, followed by 10 ml/kg of digoxin specific Fab fragments intraperitoneal at t = 30 min. The control group was pretreated with equal volumes of intraperitoneal normal saline at the same times. Immediately following the 30 min injection, both groups were given the estimated LD90 dose of Chan Su extract by subcutaneous injection. An endpoint of survival at 6 h was chosen after preliminary results showed that all deaths occurred in the first 4 h.

Hypotension and arrhythmias were treated with epinephrine, open-chest massage, and advanced cardiac life support protocols, respectively. Outcomes were defined as the following: successful (stable rhythm and MAP > or = 55 mm Hg for 20 min), successful with continued therapy (stable rhythm and MAP <55 mm Hg after 20 min), or death. Continued therapy was required in 86% of LIDO dogs compared with only 10%-30% of the other dogs (P < 0.002). Mortality from BUP, LBUP, ROP, and LIDO was 50%, 30%, 10%, and 0%, respectively. Myocardial depression was primarily responsible for the profound hypotension, as the occurrence of lethal arrhythmias preceding resuscitation was not different among local anesthetics. Epinephrine-induced ventricular fibrillation occurred more frequently in BUP-intoxicated dogs than in dogs given LIDO or ROP (P < 0.05). The unbound plasma concentrations at collapse were larger for ROP, 19.8 microg/mL (10-39 microg/mL), compared with BUP, 5.7 microg/mL (3-11 microg/mL); whereas the concentrations of LBUP, 9.4 microg/mL (5-18 microg/mL) and BUP were not significantly different from each other. There were consistent differences among the local anesthetics, the sum of which suggests that larger doses and blood concentrations of ropivacaine (ROP) and lidocaine will be tolerated as compared with bupivacaine (BUP) and levobupivacaine (LBUP). Lidocaine intoxication results in myocardial depression from which resuscitation is consistently successful but will require continuing drug support. After BUP, LBUP, or ROP, resuscitation is not always successful, and the administration of epinephrine may lead to severe arrhythmias. The unbound plasma concentrations at collapse were larger for ROP compared with BUP, whereas the concentrations of LBUP and BUP were not significantly different from each other. Furthermore, larger plasma concentrations of ROP than BUP are present after resuscitation, suggesting a wider margin of safety when large volumes and large concentrations are used to establish upper or lower extremity nerve blocks for surgical anesthesia and during long-term infusions for pain management.",success

We performed a systematic review of the literature published through 15 December 2014. Relevant articles were determined based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pre-treatment experiments, pharmacokinetic studies not involving toxicity and studies that did not address antidotal use of ILE were excluded. We included 113 studies and reports. Of these, 76 were human and 38 animal studies. One publication included both a human case report and an animal study. Human studies included one randomized controlled crossover trial involving 16 healthy volunteers. The subclinical LA toxicity design did not show a difference in the effects of ILE versus saline. There was one case series and 73 case reports of ILE use in the context of toxicity (83 patients) including CNS depression or agitation (n = 45, 54%), seizures (n = 49, 59%), hypotension, hypertension, EKG changes, arrhythmias (n = 39, 47%), cardiac arrest (n = 18, 22%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and/or requirement for endotracheal intubation and/or mechanical ventilation (n = 35, 42%). There were 81 (98%) survivors including 63 (76%) with no reported sequelae from the LA poisoning or ILE, although the presence or absence of sequelae was not reported in 15 (18%) cases. Animal studies included 29 randomized controlled studies, three observational studies, five case series, and one case report; bupivacaine was used in 29 of these reports (76%).

We aim to present and discuss the clinical case of LAST with full clinical recovery due to accidental levobupivacaine intravenous infusion in a healthy 1.5-month-old patient, resulting in cardiac arrest necessitating resuscitation. <i>Case presentation:</i> A 4-kilogram, 1.5-month-old female infant, ASA I, presented to the hospital for elective herniorrhaphy surgery. Combined anesthesia was planned, involving general endotracheal and caudal anesthesia. After anesthesia induction, cardiovascular collapse was noticed, resulting in bradycardia and later cardiac arrest with EMD (Electromechanical Dissociation). It was noticed that during induction, levobupivacaine was accidentally infused intravenously. A local anesthetic was prepared for caudal anesthesia. LET (lipid emulsion therapy) was started immediately. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was carried out according to the EMD algorithm, which lasted 12 min until spontaneous circulation was confirmed and the patient was transferred to the ICU. In ICU, the girl was extubated the second day, and the third day she was transferred to the regular pediatric unit. Finally, the patient was discharged home after a total of five days of hospitalization with full clinical recovery. A four-week follow-up has revealed that the patient recovered without any neurological or cardiac sequelae. <i>Conclusions:</i> The clinical presentation of LAST in children usually begins with cardiovascular symptoms because pediatric patients are already under general anesthesia when anesthetics are being used, as was the case in our case. Treatment and management of LAST involve cessation of local anesthetic infusion, stabilization of the airway, breathing, and hemodynamics, as well as lipid emulsion therapy.

Bupivacaine 4 mg/kg was administered to 24 anesthetized pigs. Three minutes after delivering the bupivacaine bolus, the animals were given the following: ILE 1.5 mL/kg followed by 0.25 mL/kg/min (ILE group) and B 2 mEq/kg followed by 1 mEq/kg/h (B group). Controls (C group) were given saline solution, 50 mL followed by 1 mL/kg/h. Electrophysiological parameters were evaluated in sinus rhythm and during right ventricular pacing at several time intervals up to 30 minutes. Data were analyzed as the area under the curve (AUC) for the first 10 minutes (AUC10) or 30 minutes (AUC30). Bupivacaine increased the sinus cycle length, PR interval, and QRS duration. AUC30 of the sinus rhythm QRS duration after antidote administration was significantly different among the 3 groups (P = .003). B group experienced faster recovery from intoxication than the C group (AUC10, P = .003; AUC30, P = .003) or the ILE group (AUC10, P = .018). During the first minute, 50% of the B group (versus 0% of the ILE and C groups) had recovered >30% of QRS duration (P = .011). The trend toward faster recovery in the ILE group than in the C group did not reach significance (AUC10, P = .23; AUC30, P = .06). Effects on the paced QRS duration at a rate of 150 bpm were more intense but with similar results (B versus C group: AUC10, P = .009; AUC30, P = .009; B versus ILE: AUC10, P = .015; AUC30, P = .024). The recovery process of the paced QRS tended to be slower for all antidotes. In a closed-chest swine model, B was an effective treatment for electrophysiological alterations caused by established bupivacaine toxicity. At clinical doses, B ameliorated bupivacaine electrocardiographic toxicity faster than ILE. Use-dependent effects of bupivacaine are prominent and delay the effects of both antidotes, but B produces faster recovery than ILE.",success

Arterial blood gas samples were chocolate brown in colour, with a low arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 197 mm Hg. This large oxygen saturation gap raised suspicion for methaemoglobinaemia. However, the patient's co-oximetry results were suppressed by the blood gas analyser and delayed a definitive diagnosis. A methaemalbumin screen was sent instead, which was positive at 65 mg/L (reference interval: <3 mg/L). Treatment with methylene blue was initiated but did not result in complete resolution of cyanosis. This patient had been red cell exchange dependent since childhood for thalassaemia. Therefore, an urgent red cell exchange was initiated overnight, leading to an improvement in symptoms and interpretability of co-oximetry results.

Medication review indicated that the patient was prescribed phenazopyridine 400 mg TID for the previous 2 months. This medication was discontinued. Considering she was chronically taking mirtazapine, she can increase risk of serotonin syndrome should she be administered first-line treatment with methylene blue. Vitamin C was thus instead administered as a second-line agent. Serial ABGs showed a rapid decline in methaemoglobin levels and an increase in oxyhaemoglobin within 2 days. Acquired methaemoglobinaemia is a rare adverse effect of treatment with phenazopyridine. This risk increases when drug dosage and duration exceed manufacturer specifications. Treatment typically includes cessation of the offending drug and administration of methylene blue in severe cases. A thorough medication reconciliation should be performed prior to methylene blue initiation, as patients taking serotonergic medications (for example, MAOIs, SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs) are at increased risk of serotonin toxicity with co-administration of methylene blue. In these instances, ascorbic acid/vitamin C can be chosen as an alternative treatment agent. Work-up of refractory hypoxia should involve a thorough review of medications as even some over-the-counter drugs can cause the fatal side effect of methaemoglobinaemia. Treatment with vitamin C should be considered over methylene blue if serotonergic medications have been recently prescribed in order to avoid risk of serotonin syndrome.

The epidemiology of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States is changing rapidly, with exponential increases in death resulting from synthetic opioids and linear increases in heroin deaths more than offsetting modest reductions in deaths from prescription opioids. The pathophysiology of polysubstance toxidromes involving opioids, asphyxial death, and prolonged hypoxemia leading to global ischemia (cardiac arrest) differs from that of sudden cardiac arrest. People who use opioids may also develop bacteremia, central nervous system vasculitis and leukoencephalopathy, torsades de pointes, pulmonary vasculopathy, and pulmonary edema. Emergency management of opioid poisoning requires recognition by the lay public or emergency dispatchers, prompt emergency response, and effective ventilation coupled to compressions in the setting of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Effective ventilation is challenging to teach, whereas naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be administered by emergency medical personnel, trained laypeople, and the general public with dispatcher instruction to prevent cardiac arrest. Opioid education and naloxone distributions programs have been developed to teach people who are likely to encounter a person with opioid poisoning how to administer naloxone, deliver high-quality compressions, and perform rescue breathing. Current American Heart Association recommendations call for laypeople and others who cannot reliably establish the presence of a pulse to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in any individual who is unconscious and not breathing normally; if opioid overdose is suspected, naloxone should also be administered. Secondary prevention, including counseling, opioid overdose education with take-home naloxone, and medication for opioid use disorder, is important to prevent recurrent opioid overdose.",success

The methadone group included 87 decedents, and the OOA group included 163 decedents. Most were male. Decedents in the methadone group were significantly younger than those in the OOA group: more than a quarter were 18-24 years of age. For both groups, approximately 50% had a history of pain, and 80% had a history of substance abuse. There was no intergroup difference in the prevalence of benzodiazepines at post-mortem.

Key patient variables influencing the dose that were recorded included: age, sex, initial patient presentation and reported concurrent alcohol use. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that patients with higher levels of consciousness and respiratory rates on arrival of the paramedic crew were more likely to receive a less than standard dose of naloxone. Conversely, patients with lower levels of consciousness and low respiratory rates received greater than standard doses of naloxone for resuscitation. Patients who received greater than the standard dose of naloxone were 2.25 (95% CI, 1.83-2.77) times more likely to have been under the influence of alcohol when consuming the heroin that resulted in overdose. The concurrent use of alcohol with heroin resulted in the use of greater than standard doses of naloxone by paramedics in resuscitating overdose patients. It is possible that the higher dose of naloxone is required to reverse the combined effects of alcohol and heroin.

Subjects breathed a hypercapnic gas mixture through a tight-fitting mask for an initial period of 46 min prior to a series of mask ""holidays"" introduced to reduce subject discomfort and encourage study completion. Ten minutes after initiating the hypercapnic gas mixture, a remifentanil bolus was administered, and an infusion continued for the study duration. Subjects were administered either naloxone or nalmefene 15 min after initiating the remifentanil infusion and MV monitored for 21 min followed by a mask holiday.

At the primary endpoint (5 min post administration), nalmefene increases in MV (5.75 L/min) were nearly twice that produced by naloxone (3.01 L/min) (P < .0009); the point estimate favors nalmefene, demonstrating non-inferiority and superiority. In this model of opioid-induced respiratory depression, nalmefene has a more rapid onset of action than naloxone, which required 20 min to achieve a comparable reversal of respiratory depression.

It is among the most potent opioid antagonists currently on the market and is differentiated from naloxone and naltrexone by its partial agonist activity at the kappa-opioid receptor which may benefit in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Oral nalmefene has been approved in the European Union for treatment of alcohol use disorder since 2013. As of 2023, nalmefene is available in the United States as an intranasal spray for reversal of opioid overdose but is not approved for alcohol or opioid use disorder as a maintenance treatment. The substantially longer half-life of nalmefene and 5-fold higher binding affinity to opioid receptors makes it a superior agent over naloxone in the reversal of high potency synthetic opioids like fentanyl and the emerging nitazenes. Nalmefene presents with a comparable side effect profile to other opioid antagonists and should be considered for further development as a maintenance treatment for opioid and other substance use disorders.",success

In this pilot study, we enrolled adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) who: (1) arrived after an overdose requiring naloxone for the reversal of respiratory depression; and (2) who required venipuncture or intravenous access as part of their clinical care. Blood specimens (<i>n</i> = 20) underwent comprehensive toxicology testing, including the quantitation of fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and naloxone, as well as the detection of common sedative-hypnotics and a wide range of other illicit and pharmaceutical substances. We then compared fentanyl concentrations to naloxone dosing in participants with and without a concomitant sedative-hypnotic exposure. Nineteen of twenty participants (95%) were exposed to fentanyl prior to their overdose; the remaining participant tested positive for heroin metabolites. No participants reported pharmaceutical fentanyl use. Fentanyl analogs - acetylfentanyl or carfentanil - were present in three specimens. In 11 cases, fentanyl and its metabolites were the only opioids identified.

This translational model was originally developed by Mann et al. (Clin Pharmacol Ther 2022) to evaluate the effectiveness of intramuscular (IM) naloxone. We initially implemented this model using published codes, reproducing the effects reported by Mann et al. on the incidence of cardiac arrest events following intravenous doses of fentanyl and carfentanil as well as the reduction in cardiac arrest events following a standard 2 mg IM dose of naloxone. We then expanded the model in terms of pharmacokinetic and µ-opioid receptor binding parameters to simulate effects of 4 mg naloxone hydrochloride IN and 3 mg nalmefene hydrochloride IN, both FDA-approved for the treatment of opioid overdose. Model simulations were conducted to quantify the percentage of cardiac arrest in 2000 virtual patients in both the presence and absence of IN antagonist treatment. Following simulated overdoses with both fentanyl and carfentanil in chronic opioid users, IN nalmefene produced a substantially greater reduction in the incidence of cardiac arrest compared to IN naloxone. For example, following a dose of fentanyl (1.63 mg) producing cardiac arrest in 52.1% (95% confidence interval, 47.3-56.8) of simulated patients, IN nalmefene reduced this rate to 2.2% (1.0-3.8) compared to 19.2% (15.5-23.3) for IN naloxone. Nalmefene also produced large and clinically meaningful reductions in the incidence of cardiac arrests in opioid naïve subjects. Across dosing scenarios, simultaneous administration of four doses of IN naloxone were needed to reduce the percentage of cardiac arrest events to levels that approached those produced by a single dose of IN nalmefene. Simulations using this validated translational model of opioid overdose demonstrate that a single dose of IN nalmefene produces clinically meaningful reductions in the incidence of cardiac arrest compared to IN naloxone following a synthetic opioid overdose.

More patients in the IN group received two doses of naloxone (34% vs. 18%, p = 0.05), and three patients in the IN group received a subsequent dose of IV or IM naloxone. The time from dose administration to clinical response for naloxone was longer for the IN route, but the overall time from patient contact to response was the same for the IV and IN routes. Given the difficulty and potential hazards in obtaining IV access in many patients with narcotic overdose, IN naloxone appears to be a useful and potentially safer alternative.",success

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of this practice and determine whether increased mortality is associated with full reversal of opioids. As a component of a comprehensive quality assurance initiative, we assessed mortality during the 48 hours after patients received naloxone to reverse opioid overdose followed by patient-initiated refusal of transportation. The setting was a large urban fire-based EMS system. Investigators provided the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office (MEO) with a list of patients who were treated by the San Antonio Fire Department with naloxone, and not transported. Inclusion criteria were administration of naloxone and patient-initiated refusal. Patient dispositions also included aid only, referral to the MEO, or referral to law enforcement. The list was then compared with the MEO database. A chart review was completed on all patients treated and subsequently presented to the MEO within two days. A secondary time period of 30 days was also assessed. The list identified 592 patients treated with naloxone and not transported to the emergency department. Five-hundred fifty-two patients received naloxone and refused transport or were not transported. The remaining 40 patients all presented to EMS in cardiac arrest, naloxone was administered during the course of resuscitation, and subsequent efforts were terminated in the field. None of the patients receiving naloxone with a subsequent patient-initiated refusal were examined at the MEO within the two-day end point. The 30-day assessment revealed that nine individuals were treated with naloxone and subsequently died, but the shortest time interval between date of service and date of death was four days.

Validation of the St. Paul's Early Discharge Rule is necessary to ensure that these criteria are appropriate to apply to patients presenting after an unintentional presumed opioid overdose in the context of emerging synthetic opioids and expanded naloxone access. In this prospective, observational validation study, emergency medicine providers assessed patients 1 hour after administration of prehospital naloxone. Unlike in the derivation study the threshold for normal oxygen saturation was set at 95% and patients were not immediately discharged after a normal 1-hour evaluation. Patients were judged to have a normal 1-hour evaluation if all six criteria of the rule were met. Patients were judged to have an adverse event (AE) if they had one or more of the preestablished AEs.

Take-home naloxone provision directly to opioid users for emergency use has been implemented recently in more than 15 countries worldwide, albeit mainly as pilot schemes and without formal evaluation. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of take-home naloxone, with two specific aims: (1) to study the impact of take-home naloxone distribution on overdose-related mortality; and (2) to assess the safety of take-home naloxone in terms of adverse events. PubMed, MEDLINE and PsychINFO were searched for English-language peer-reviewed publications (randomized or observational trials) using the Boolean search query: (opioid OR opiate) AND overdose AND prevention. Evidence was evaluated using the nine Bradford Hill criteria for causation, devised to assess a potential causal relationship between public health interventions and clinical outcomes when only observational data are available. A total of 1397 records (1164 after removal of duplicates) were retrieved, with 22 observational studies meeting eligibility criteria. Due to variability in size and quality of the included studies, meta-analysis was dismissed in favour of narrative synthesis. From eligible studies, we found take-home naloxone met all nine Bradford Hill criteria. The additional five World Health Organization criteria were all either met partially (two) or fully (three). Even with take-home naloxone administration, fatal outcome was reported in one in 123 overdose cases (0.8%; 95% confidence interval = 0.4, 1.2). Take-home naloxone programmes are found to reduce overdose mortality among programme participants and in the community and have a low rate of adverse events.",success

P-2-AM was more effective when given 30 min. after the organophosphate. The effect of 25 mg./kg. P-2-AM on the phosphorylated true cholinesterase in brain (experiments with TEPP and E 600) was negligible. A dose of 25 mg./kg.

The antidotal efficacy of new oximes is primarily tested in animals for ethical reasons. However, the various interactions between AChE, OP and oximes can be investigated with human AChE which enables the direct assessment of oxime potency, thus excluding species differences. The kinetics of inhibition, reactivation and aging were investigated with human erythrocyte AChE, various structurally different OP (organophosphates, -phosphonates and phosphoramidates) and oximes (obidoxime, pralidoxime, HI 6, HLö 7). The inhibitory potency of OPs, reactivating potency of oximes and spontaneous reactivation and aging were strongly affected by the structural characteristics of the OPs and of the phosphyl-AChE-complex. The kinetic data emphasize the superior inhibitory potency of organophosphonates. AChE inhibited by various phosphoramidates was mostly resistant towards reactivation by oximes while phosphonylated AChE was easily reactivated. HLö 7 was most potent with phosphonylated AChE and obidoxime with AChE inhibited by organophosphates and phosphoramidates. With the exception of soman, OP-inhibited AChE aged rather slowly (t(1/2) 3-231 h) and reactivated spontaneously with some compounds.

An open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted in Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Chittagong, Bangladesh, on 156 hospitalized individuals with OPC poisoning from June to September 2006. The aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of conventional bolus doses with individualized incremental doses of atropine for atropinization followed by continuous atropine infusion for management of OPC poisoning. Inclusion criteria were patients with a clear history of OPC poisoning with clear clinical signs of toxicity, i.e. features of cholinergic crisis. The patients were observed for at least 96 h. Immediate outcome and complications were recorded. Out of 156 patients, 81 patients received conventional bolus dose atropine (group A) and 75 patients received rapidly incremental doses of atropine followed by infusion (group B). The mortality in group 'A' was 22.5% (18/80) and in group 'B' 8% (6/75) (p < 0.05). The mean duration of atropinization in group 'A' was 151.74 min compared to 23.90 min for group 'B' (p < 0.001).

Rapid incremental dose atropinization followed by atropine infusion reduces mortality and morbidity from OPC poisoning and shortens the length of hospital stay and recovery.

Twenty-four other patients with the same EMC diagnosis were admitted to the MICU during this period but did not receive NaHCO3. The response of blood pressure, electrocardiographic parameters, and mental status to serum alkalinization with NaHCO3 were evaluated. Major morbidity and mortality were recorded for all patients. Hypotension was corrected within 1 hour in 20 of 21 (96%) patients, QRS prolongation corrected in 39 of 49 (80%), and mental status improved in 40 of 85 (47%). There was one death, in a patient who was moribund on arrival to the EMC. No complications were attributable to the administration of NaHCO3.

This was a retrospective review of TCA poisonings from three Australian toxicology units and a poisons information centre (Jan 2013 to Jan 2019). We included patients with TCA toxicity who ingested>10 mg/kg or had clinically significant toxicities consistent with TCA poisoning, and analysed patients' clinical, electrocardiogram and biochemical data. Of 210 patients, 84 received NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and ventilation (dual therapy), 12 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> , 46 ventilation and 68 supportive care treatment. When compared with single/supportive groups, patients who received dual therapy had taken a significantly higher median dose of TCA (1.5 g vs1.3 g, P < .001), a longer median maximum QRS interval (124 ms, interquartile ranges [IQR] 108-138 vs106 ms, IQR 98-115, P < .001) and were more likely to have seizures (14% vs3%, P = .006) and arrhythmias (17% vs1%, P < .001). The dual therapy group demonstrated greater increases in serum pH (median 0.11, IQR 0.04-0.17) compared to the single/supportive therapy group (median 0.03, IQR -0.01-0.09, p < .001). A greater proportion of patients reached the target pH 7.45-7.55 in the dual therapy group (59%) compared to the single/supportive therapy group (10%) (P < .001). For each 100 mmol bolus of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> given, the median increase in serum sodium was 2.5 mmol/L (IQR 1.5-4.0). QRS narrowing occurred twice as quickly in the dual therapy vs single/supportive therapy group. A combination of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and mechanical ventilation was most effective in achieving serum alkalinisation and was associated with a more rapid narrowing of the QRS interval.

17288499,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"The cardiac sodium channel is comprised of proteins that span the cardiac cell membrane and form the channel pore. Depolarisation causes the proteins to move and open the sodium channel. Once the channel is open (active conformation), sodium ions move into the cell. The channel then changes from the active conformation to an inactive conformation - the channel remains open, but influx of sodium ions ceases. Recovery occurs as the channel moves from the inactive conformation back to the closed conformation and is then ready to open following the next depolarisation. Sodium channel blocking drugs (NCBDs) occupy receptors in the channel during the active and inactive conformations. The drug dissociates from most of the channel receptors during recovery, but the time it takes the drug to dissociate slows recovery. The slowed recovery prolongs conduction time, the main toxicity of NCBD overdose. Conduction time is further prolonged if heart rate increases as there are more available active and inactive conformations/unit time, which increases channel receptor binding sites for the NCBD. In addition to prolonging conduction time, NCBDs also decrease inotropy. Treatment of NCBD cardiotoxicity has been based on in vitro and animal experiments, and case reports. Assumptions based on this evidence must now be reassessed. For example, canines consistently develop ventricular tachycardia (VT) when tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are administered. Much of the literature discussing NCBD cardiotoxicity assumes that TCA poisoning induces VT in humans with the same regularity that occurs in canines. Seemingly, in support of this assumption was the finding that patients with remote myocardial infarction developed VT when therapeutically ingesting a NCBD. However, conduction is prolonged in myocardium that is or has been ischaemic. NCBD prolong conduction more in previously ischaemic myocardium than in normal myocardium, which causes nonuniform conduction and allows the development of re-entrant arrhythmias such as VT. Although some nonuniform conduction may occur in the healthy heart following a NCBD overdose, there is no evidence that nonuniform conduction occurs to the extent that it will cause re-entrant arrhythmias in this setting. Using various animal models and a variety of NCBDs, sodium ions, bicarbonate ions and alkalosis have been compared for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, hypotension and mortality. The results of these experiments have been extrapolated to NCBD overdose in humans. Animal models and single treatment approaches may have narrowed our scope. More recent evidence indicates that properties of each individual NCBD may require unique treatment. There is limited evidence that glucagon, which increases initial sodium ion influx into the cardiac cell, should be considered early in the treatment of cardiotoxicity. Another consideration may be treatment of NCBD with faster kinetics. Conduction time is decreased if a NCBD occupying the receptor is replaced by a NCBD that moves off and on the receptor more quickly. There is less evidence for this treatment, as risk may be greater. With greater understanding of the sodium channel and NCBDs, we must reassess our approach to the treatment of patients with healthy hearts who overdose on NCBD.",success
38597366,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is advocated for the treatment of sodium channel blocker poisoning, but its efficacy varies amongst different sodium channel blockers. This Commentary addresses common pitfalls and appropriate usage of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate therapy in cardiotoxic drug poisonings. Serum alkalinization is best achieved by the synergistic effect of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation (PCO<sub>2</sub> ∼ 30-35 mmHg [0.47-0.6 kPa]). This reduces the dose of sodium bicarbonate required to achieve serum alkalinization (pH ∼ 7.45-7.55) and avoids adverse effects from excessive doses of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate. Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning responds well to sodium bicarbonate therapy, but many other sodium channel blockers may not. For instance, drugs that block the intercellular gap junctions, such as bupropion, do not respond well to alkalinization. For sodium channel blocker poisonings in which the expected response is unknown, a bolus of 1-2 mmol/kg sodium bicarbonate can be used to assess the response to alkalinization. Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate can cause electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia, leading to QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes in poisonings with drugs that have mixed sodium and potassium cardiac channel properties, such as hydroxychloroquine and flecainide. Excessive doses of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate commonly occur if it is administered until the QRS complex duration is < 100 ms. A prolonged QRS complex duration is not specific for sodium channel blocker toxicity. Some sodium channel blockers do not respond, and even when there is a response, it takes a few hours for the QRS complex duration to return completely to normal. In addition, QRS complex prolongation can be due to a rate-dependent bundle branch block. So, no further doses should be given after achieving serum alkalinization (pH ∼ 7.45-7.55). A further strategy to avoid overdosing patients with hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is to set maximum doses. Exceeding 6 mmol/kg is likely to cause hypernatremia, fluid overload, metabolic alkalosis, and cerebral oedema in many patients and potentially be lethal. We propose that hypertonic sodium bicarbonate therapy be used in patients with sodium channel blocker poisoning who have clinically significant toxicities such as seizures, shock (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, mean arterial pressure <65 mmHg) or ventricular dysrhythmia. We recommend initial bolus dosing of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate of 1-2 mmol/kg, which can be repeated if the patient remains unstable, up to a maximum dose of 6 mmol/kg. This is recommended to be administered in conjunction with mechanical ventilation and hyperventilation to achieve serum alkalinization (PCO<sub>2</sub>∼30-35 mmHg [4-4.7 kPa]) and a pH of ∼7.45-7.55. With repeated bolus doses of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, it is imperative to monitor and correct potassium and sodium abnormalities and observe changes in serum pH and on the electrocardiogram. Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate is an effective antidote for certain sodium channel blocker poisonings, such as tricyclic antidepressants, and when used in appropriate dosing, it works synergistically with hyperventilation to achieve serum alkalinization and to reduce sodium channel blockade. However, there are many pitfalls that can lead to excessive sodium bicarbonate therapy and severe adverse effects.",success

According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2013, at least 2113 human fatalities attributed to poisonings occurred in the United States of America. In this article, we review the data regarding the impact of systemic sodium bicarbonate administration in the management of certain poisonings including sodium channel blocker toxicities, salicylate overdose, and ingestion of some toxic alcohols and in various pharmacological toxicities. Based on the available literature and empiric experience, the administration of sodium bicarbonate appears to be beneficial in the management of a patient with the above-mentioned toxidromes. However, most of the available evidence originates from case reports, case series, and expert consensus recommendations. The potential mechanisms of sodium bicarbonate include high sodium load and the development of metabolic alkalosis with resultant decreased tissue penetration of the toxic substance with subsequent increased urinary excretion. While receiving sodium bicarbonate, patients must be monitored for the development of associated side effects including electrolyte abnormalities, the progression of metabolic alkalosis, volume overload, worsening respiratory status, and/or worsening metabolic acidosis.

Recently, improvements in the ECMO circuitry rendered it more biocompatible. The surprisingly low mortality in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome who were treated with ECMO in the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic of 2009 resurrected interest in ECMO in many intensive care units around the world. This article reviews the different techniques of ECMO, the indications, contraindications and complications of its use, its role in poisoned patients and the ethics of its use. We searched Pubmed, Toxnet, Cochrane database and Embase from 1966 to September 2012 using the search terms (''extracorporeal membrane oxygenation'', 'extracorporeal life support', 'ECMO', 'ECLS', 'assist-device', and 'intox*' or 'poison*'). These searches identified 242 papers of which 116 described ECMO in conditions other than intoxications or were reviews. In total 46 publications selected for this manuscript were case reports or case series involving poisoned patients. ECMO TECHNIQUES: Two types of ECMO are used: veno-venous ECMO (VV-ECMO) or veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO). VV-ECMO is used for patients with severe ARDS to secure adequate oxygenation of the organs while protecting the lungs from harmful ventilation pressures or prolonged inspiratory fraction of oxygen. VA-ECMO can be used whenever the patient remains in shock despite adequate fluid resuscitation and is refractory to administration of inotropes and vasopressors. The organ support that can be applied with ECMO makes it especially useful in patients with severe poisoning as the clinical impact of the intoxication is often temporary; ECMO can be used as a 'bridge to recovery'. Absolute contraindications are uncontrolled coagulopathy and severe intracranial bleeding, which precludes the use of anticoagulation therapy. Relative contraindications to ECMO include advanced age, severe irreversible brain injury, untreatable metastatic cancer, severe organ dysfunction (some suggest a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score > 15), and high pressure positive pressure ventilation for more than 7 days. The most common complication of ECMO is either bleeding at the cannulation site (in VV-ECMO) or bleeding at the surgical entry site (in VA-ECMO). Overall bleeding complications currently occur in 10-36% patients, and intracranial haemorrhage is seen in up to 6% of patients. ECMO should be reserved, therefore, for the most severely ill poisoned patients with a high risk of death. ECMO in poisoned patients. There are no randomised trials of ECMO in poisoned patients with refractory shock or who have ARDS caused by an intoxication. VV-ECMO can be considered in patients with type l and ll respiratory failure. In patients with life-threatening haemodynamic instability, VA-ECMO can be considered when shock persists despite volume administration, inotropes and vasoconstrictors, and (sometimes) intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. Typical examples include poisoning due to calcium channel antagonists, beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, chloroquine and colchicine. ETHICS OF ECMO USE: It is only ethical to use such a costly intervention (£19,252 and US$ 31,000 per quality-adjusted life year) if the treatment has a real purpose such as a 'bridge to recovery', a 'bridge to transplant', or a 'bridge to permanent assist device' (in the case of persistent cardiac failure). In the last decade, ECMO equipment has improved considerably, rendering it more biocompatible, and it has been used more frequently as an assist device for patients needing oxygenation as well as circulatory support. ECMO is considered a good salvage therapy for patients who are severely poisoned with ARDS or refractory circulatory shock.",success

However, few reports have documented cases of TCA intoxication that required intensive care, including VA-ECMO or TTM. A 19-year-old Japanese man with a history of depression was brought to our hospital because he was in a comatose state with a generalized seizure. Before admission, he had taken an unknown amount of amitriptyline. After intubation, the electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed a wide QRS complex tachycardia, and the patient suffered from cardiovascular instability despite intravenous bolus of sodium bicarbonate. At 200 minutes after ingestion, he experienced a TCA-induced cardiac arrest. We initiated VA-ECMO 240 minutes after ingestion. The hemodynamic status stabilized, and the ECG abnormality improved gradually. In addition, we initiated targeted temperature management (TTM) with a target temperature of 34°C.

Traditionally, these therapies have consisted of intravenous fluids, sodium bicarbonate, vasopressors, and cardiac pacing. Novel therapies include intravenous fat emulsion and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). A 24-year-old woman ingested her husband's flecainide and presented to the emergency department (ED) in profound shock with a wide complex bradydysrhythmia. Despite aggressive medical therapy including sodium bicarbonate, vasopressors, cardiac pacing, and intravenous fat emulsion, her condition deteriorated and she developed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cardiac arrest refractory to standard resuscitation.

20507243,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) poisoning is a relatively common occurrence and remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. Deaths from TCA toxicity are typically due to cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias and hypotension. Cardiovascular toxicity may be multifactorial. However, the primary mechanism is a TCA-induced membrane-depressant or ""quinidine-like"" effect on the myocardium resulting in slowing down of phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential and subsequent impairment of conduction through the His-Purkinje system and myocardium. This effect is manifest as QRS prolongation on the EKG, atrioventricular (AV) block, and impairment in automaticity leading to hypotension and ventricular dysrhythmia. Primary treatment strategies include sodium bicarbonate, hypertonic saline, and correction of any conditions that may aggravate this toxicity such as acidosis, hyperthermia, and hypotension. In cases of severe TCA toxicity, administration of sodium bicarbonate may be insufficient to correct the cardiac conduction defects. Use of lidocaine or phenytoin, both Vaughan Williams Class IB antiarrhythmic agents, has been reported as an effective adjunctive therapy in cases of severe cardiotoxicity. Thirty articles of interest were identified by searching PubMed, abstracts from meetings, and the reference sections of related primary and review articles and toxicological texts. ROLE OF LIDOCAINE AND PHENYTOIN: Lidocaine and phenytoin also cause sodium channel blockade, but unlike Class IA or IC agents do not depress phase 0 depolarization in healthy cardiac tissue. Lidocaine and phenytoin dissociate relatively quickly from cardiac sodium channels. Sodium channels have faster recovery times after exposure to lidocaine (1-2 s) and phenytoin (0.71 s), than with some TCAs such as amitriptyline (13.6 s), but not others (e.g., imipramine at 1.6 s). In experimental models of amitriptyline poisoning, lidocaine co-administration resulted in decreased sodium channel blockade compared to amitriptyline alone. This correlated with clinical improvement, including normalization of QRS interval, improved hypotension, and decreased mortality. It is postulated that lidocaine's rapid binding to the sodium channel may directly displace slower acting agents from the channel, leaving more channels unbound, and therefore be able to facilitate cardiac conduction. Phenytoin may act through a similar mechanism as lidocaine, although experimental studies suggest that it does not compete directly for the same sodium channel binding site as TCAs. Allosteric modulation of the TCA binding site may occur in the setting of phenytoin use. The evidence for using phenytoin in treating TCA-induced sodium channel blockade is less convincing than that for lidocaine. Human trials are limited to case series and, in most human exposures in which there appeared to be efficacy, the toxicity was not severe. Although there appears to be more evidence for the use of lidocaine than phenytoin as adjunctive treatment for TCA-associated cardiotoxicity, specific clinical indications and dosing recommendations remain to be defined. We recommend the use of lidocaine in cases in which cardiotoxicity (arrhythmias, hypotension) is refractory to treatment with sodium bicarbonate or hypertonic saline, or in which physiological derangement (e.g., severe alkalosis or hypernatremia) limits effective use of these primary strategies.",success

A 50-year-old male with atrial fibrillation and taking flecainide 75 mg twice daily presented to Emergency Department after ingesting 1125 mg of flecainide, in a suicide attempt. An electrocardiogram (ECG) on arrival showed bradycardia, wide QRS complex, prolonged QTc interval. Treatment for flecainide poisoning with intravenous sodium bicarbonate was initiated. On day two, the patient had a cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular tachycardia. After successful defibrillation, the patient had persistent bradycardia and hypotension. Administration of a 20% lipid emulsion bolus, followed by continuous infusion for three hours, resulted in conversion to normal sinus rhythm. This case illustrates the successful treatment of flecainide toxicity with intravenous fat emulsion therapy. To our knowledge, this is the second case that used fat emulsion without concomitant extracorporeal life support. Due to its low prevalence and the fact the lipid emulsion is often used in conjunction with other treatments, there are no randomized clinical trials on the isolated efficacy of lipid infusion. The best treatment is unknown. Given its high mortality, early detection and treatment are paramount.",success

We aimed to analyze case reports on LE administration for resuscitation of toxicity induced by these drugs in pediatric patients. Case reports involving pediatric patients undergoing LE treatment for toxicity caused by nonlocal anesthetic drugs until December 31, 2021, were searched through PubMed and Scopus using the following terms: ""toxicity, or intoxication, or poisoning, or overdose"" and ""LE or intralipid."" Twenty-eight cases on LE treatment for toxicity induced by nonlocal anesthetic drugs in pediatric patients (younger than 19 years) were retrieved. The total number of patients was 31. Lipid emulsion treatment was carried out during toxicity caused by amitriptyline, flecainide, bupropion, propranolol, and lamotrigine, which was unresponsive to supportive treatment. These drugs are highly lipid-soluble and inhibit cardiac sodium channels, which is similar to pharmacological properties of the local anesthetic bupivacaine. The most frequent method of delivery involved bolus administration followed by continuous infusion; 1.5 mL/kg LE administration followed by 0.25 mL/kg/min LE was most frequently used. Lipid emulsion improved various symptoms of drug toxicity in 29 patients (29/31, 93.54%), and symptoms were improved in 14 patients (14/31, 45.16%) within an h after LE administration. The trend in frequency of improved symptoms after LE treatment was as follows: the cardiovascular symptom alone > symptoms of the central nervous system alone > symptoms of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. The adverse effects of LE treatment in the reported cases were hypertriglyceridemia, mild pancreatitis, and elevated levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransaminases. Lipid emulsion treatment may be effective in ameliorating intractable cardiovascular depression when systemic toxicity caused by drugs, including cardiac sodium channel blockers, is unresponsive to supportive treatments.",success

Flecainide is a lipophilic anti-arrhythmic with a significant cardiotoxic profile, with blockade of sodium and potassium channels causing arrhythmias and shock in severe toxicity. ILE has been proposed as a treatment option in severe flecainide toxicity refractory to other modalities. We compared the effects of ILE and hypertonic sodium bicarbonate in a rabbit model of flecainide toxicity. Twenty sedated and ventilated New Zealand White Rabbits received flecainide infusion titrated to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60% baseline, which was defined as toxicity. The rabbits then received either sodium bicarbonate or ILE, and the flecainide infusion was reduced in an attempt to model ongoing enteric absorption. MAP and heart rate were recorded every minute for 15 min and plasma flecainide concentration was measured at toxicity and 15 min. ECG QRS duration was recorded at baseline, toxicity and at 5, 10 and 15 min post-toxicity. No difference was observed in heart rate (p = 0.2804), MAP (p = 0.1802) or QRS duration (p = 0.7471) between groups. The immediate rate of rise in MAP was greatest in the bicarbonate group in the 5 min immediately post-toxicity. In this study, no differences were observed between an active control of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate and ILE for the primary endpoint of MAP at 15 min nor for QRS duration at any timepoint. There was a transient rapid increase in blood pressure seen in the sodium bicarbonate group that was not sustained. No increase was seen in blood concentration of flecainide in the ILE group, suggesting no 'lipid sink' for flecainide in this model. More research is warranted to define any role for ILE in flecainide toxicity.",success

We postulated additional benefit with plasma exchange therapy undertaken subsequent to lipid injection, hypothesising enhanced blood carriage of lipophilic toxin to increase yield when combined with an extracorporeal method of elimination. Instrumented rabbits underwent clomipramine infusion at 3.2 mg/kg/min to target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50% baseline, then continuously at 2 mg/kg/min to death or 90 min. Resuscitation with saline (Control), sodium bicarbonate (BIC), ILE, or lipid emulsion plus cycled plasma exchange (LEPE), was commenced on attaining target MAP. Greater survival was observed in animals receiving lipid emulsion from both LE and LEPE groups (Control median 12.0 [IQR 10.5 – 20] min, BIC median 30 [IQR 19 – 33] min, LE 85 [IQR 30 – 90] min, LEPE 90 min; P 0.0001). No difference was observed in MAP, Heart Rate, or Electrocardiograph QRS duration between surviving LE and LEPE animals at 90 min. Mean plasma exchange of 52%circulating plasma volume returned only 0.04% of the administered clomipramine load in LEPE group animals. Infusion of lipid emulsion resulted in greater survival in this rabbit model of intravenous clomipramine toxicity. Plasma exchange performed in conjunction with administration of lipid emulsion failed to result in significant extracorporeal clomipramine elimination.

Severe poisoning can be resistant to traditional treatments. Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) has been recommended as a novel therapy for the treatment of such overdoses; however, a little is known about the effects of ILE-infusion on drug concentration and haemodynamics in the early/absorptive phase after oral poisoning. Thirty minutes after oro-gastric administration of amitriptyline (70 mg/kg), either 20% intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE), 8.4% sodium bicarbonate or Hartmann's solution was infused to anaesthetized and ventilated rodents (n = 10 per group). Heart rate, blood pressure, cutaneous ECG - QRS interval duration (QRS-d), and survival were serially recorded over 120 min. Blood drug concentrations were also collected during this period. Continuous variables were compared using one-way ANOVA. ILE infusion significantly decreased the survival compared to other treatments (10% ILE vs 70% bicarbonate vs 70% Hartmann's solution, p = 0.005). There was a gradual prolongation of QRS-d and fall in blood pressure over time compared to baseline (T0) measurement for both ILE and Hartmann's solution treatments. This was associated with significantly increased blood AMI concentration with ILE treatment at T60, T90 and T120 min to the other treatments (p < 0.02). Administration of ILE early after oral amitriptyline overdose resulted in worse survival and no improvement in haemodynamics. In addition, blood amitriptyline concentrations were higher in the ILE-treated group.

Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) is a recent antidote for lipophilic drug overdose with unclear effectiveness. ILE has been studied in TCA overdose in small animals, and cases are reported in humans, but controlled studies in a larger animal model are lacking. Given the high lipophilicity of amitriptyline, a TCA, the hypothesis was that ILE would be more effective than the standard antidote sodium bicarbonate in improving amitriptyline-induced hypotension. The objective was to determine if ILE improved hypotension (defined by a mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 60% baseline) compared to sodium bicarbonate for amitriptyline overdose in a critically ill porcine model. In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, 24 female Sus scrofa swine weighing 45 to 55 kg were infused with amitriptyline at 0.5 mg/kg/min until the MAP reached 60% of baseline values. Animals were randomized to the experimental treatment group (ILE 7 mL/kg bolus, then 0.25 mL/kg/min) or the standard treatment group (sodium bicarbonate 2 mEq/kg plus an equal volume of saline). The primary outcome was a 50% improvement in MAP after ILE administration. We continuously monitored heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (sBP), MAP, and cardiac output. Electrocardiograms were recorded every 15 minutes. Serum pH, pCO2 , bicarbonate, lactate, and electrolytes were measured. Amitriptyline levels were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical methods used to detect a difference in MAP between the two treatment groups included repeated-measures analysis of variance, adjusted for treatment, time, and the interaction of treatment by time. A sample size of 12 animals per group provided a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05 to detect a 50% difference in MAP. There was no difference at baseline between ILE and sodium bicarbonate groups in mean HR, sBP, MAP, or cardiac output. Mean amounts of amitriptyline to reach hypotension and time to hypotension were similar between groups. After hypotension there was no difference between groups for mean HR, sBP, MAP, or cardiac output. The median time from hypotension to death was greater for the sodium bicarbonate group (10 minutes [IQR = 6 to 61 minutes] vs. 5 minutes [IQR = 4.5 to 6 minutes] for the ILE group; p = 0.003), but overall survival was not different. One ILE and four sodium bicarbonate pigs survived. Additionally, no difference was detected in QRS intervals between the two groups. The mean (±SD) amitriptyline level in the lipid layer was 3.34 (±2.12) μg/mL, and in the aqueous layer, 4.69 (±2.44) μg/mL. The ILE fatty layer contained 38.2% of total measurable amitriptyline, while the aqueous layer contained 53.6%. Intravenous lipid emulsion treatment failed to improve amitriptyline-induced hypotension when compared to the standard treatment of sodium bicarbonate in a large animal model of severe TCA overdose. Larger groups with better survival may yield different results from the high mortality observed in this pilot study. Similar amounts of amitriptyline were found in the aqueous and lipid layers.

These decedents usually have had significant physical exertion associated with violent and/or bizarre behavior, have been restrained by the police, and often have drug intoxication. Autopsy material from these cases may not provide a satisfactory explanation for the cause of death, and these deaths are then attributed to the excited delirium syndrome. The pathogenesis of excited delirium deaths is likely multifactorial and includes positional asphyxia, hyperthermia, drug toxicity, and/or catecholamine-induced fatal arrhythmias. We suggest that these deaths are secondary to stress cardiomyopathy similar to the cardiomyopathy seen in older women following either mental or physical stress. This syndrome develops secondary to the toxic effects of high levels of catecholamines on either cardiac myocytes or on the coronary microvasculature. Patients with stress cardiomyopathy have unique ventricular morphology on echocardiograms and left ventricular angiography and have had normal coronary angiograms. People who die under unusual circumstances associated with high catecholamine levels have contraction bands in their myocardium. Consequently, the pathogenesis of the excited delirium syndrome could be evaluated by using echocardiograms in patients brought to the emergency centers, and by more careful assessment of the myocardium and coronary vessels at autopsy.

Cardiac sensitization, which can result in serious arrhythmia and death, requires a certain critical blood level of both the sensitizing agent and epinephrine. The original research and methods utilized an exogenous epinephrine challenge during inhalation exposure to a chemical to assess cardiac sensitization potential in Beagle dogs. These screening tests were developed about 30 years ago, although in the last 15 years some modifications of these methods have occurred in response to testing chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacements. Results from these experimental cardiac sensitization studies have been used for semi-quantitative risk evaluation for occupational exposures but now are being used more quantitatively for regulatory purposes. The risks associated with cardiac sensitization from CFC replacements are unknown but expected to be low based on cardiac sensitization studies in the 1970s where dogs were made to generate their own adrenaline. With the advent of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, greater emphasis is being placed on quantitative risk assessment for cardiac sensitization.

Although cardiac sensitization to such ""industrial"" halocarbons can result in serious arrhythmia and death, research into its mechanistic basis has been limited, whereas the literature on volatile anesthetics (e.g., halothane, chloroform) is comparably extensive. A review of the literature on halocarbons and related volatile anesthetics was conducted. The available experimental evidence suggests that volatile anesthetics at physiologically relevant concentrations interact predominantly with the main repolarizing cardiac potassium channels hERG and I(Ks), as well as with calcium and sodium channels at slightly higher concentrations. On the level of the heart, inhibition of these ion channels is prone to alter both action potential shape (triangulation) and electrical impulse conduction, which may facilitate arrhythmogenesis by volatile anesthetics per se and is potentiated by catecholamines. Action potential triangulation by regionally heterogeneous inhibition of calcium and potassium channels will facilitate catecholamine-induced afterdepolarizations, triggered activity, and enhanced automaticity. Inhibition of cardiac sodium channels will reduce conduction velocity and alter refractory period; this is potentiated by catecholamines and promotes reentry arrhythmias. Other cardiac and/or neuronal mechanisms might also contribute to arrhythmogenesis. The few scattered in vitro data available for halocarbons (e.g., FC-12, halon 1301, trichloroethylene) suggest inhibition of cardiac sodium (conduction), calcium and potassium channels (triangulation), extraneuronal catecholamine reuptake, and various neuronal ion channels. Therefore, it is hypothesized that halocarbons promote cardiac sensitization by similar mechanisms as volatile anesthetics. Experimental approaches for further investigation of these sensitization mechanisms by selected halocarbons are suggested.",success

We investigated the electrophysiological changes associated with cardiomyocyte exposure to epinephrine and a halocarbon known to be associated with cardiac sensitization (halon 1301, CF3Br). Cardiomyocytes (CMs) were isolated from neonatal rats and grown on multielectrode arrays (MEAs). Upon exposure to epinephrine, the CM inter-spike interval (ISI) was decreased 14% at 10 microg/L (P<0.05) and 27% at 100 microg/L (P<0.05) as compared to baseline. Halon alone (50 mg/L) mildly prolonged the field potential (FP) duration (7%). CMs exposed to combinations of epinephrine (100 microg/L) and halon (50 mg/L) for 15 min showed a blunted increase in the ISI (35+/-12%) and a 38% decrease in conduction velocity (P<0.05) when compared to epinephrine alone. There was no change in field potential properties, but dephosphorylated connexin 43 (Cx43) was increased 60+/-16% with the combination as compared to epinephrine alone (P<0.05). Treatment with okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, prevented the Cx43 dephosphorylation and the reduction in conduction velocity upon exposure to halon and epinephrine. Moreover, the electrophysiological changes induced by epinephrine and halon were indistinguishable from those seen with the gap junction inhibitor heptanol. In conclusion, the combination of a halocarbon and epinephrine results in a unique electrophysiological signature including slow conduction that may explain, in part, the basis for cardiac sensitization. The slowing of conduction is most likely related to changes in the phosphorylation state of Cx43.",success

Several cases of lethal arrhythmia after intoxication with chloroform have been described. Pharmacological inhibition of cardiac ""human ether-à-go-go-related gene"" (HERG) potassium channels is linked to proarrhythmic effects of cardiac and noncardiac drugs. To further investigate the electrophysiological basis of the arrhythmogenic potential of chloroform, we analysed inhibitory effects of chloroform on cloned HERG potassium channels, heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293) cells using the double-electrode voltage-clamp technique and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, respectively. In HEK cells, chloroform blocked HERG tail currents with an IC(50) of 4.97mM. Biophysical properties were further investigated in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Onset and wash-out of block was fast and inhibition was completely reversible. Chloroform did not alter channel activation, however, direct channel inactivation was accelerated significantly. Steady-state-inactivation of HERG was not affected. Chloroform dependent block of HERG channels was voltage dependent with a decrease of inhibition at more positive membrane potentials. No frequency-dependence of block could be observed. In summary, chloroform blocked HERG potassium channels probably in a toxicologically relevant concentration.

The emerging use of ILE administration in clinical toxicology warrants careful attention to its potential adverse effects. The dosing regimen and context of administration leading to the adverse events documented in this review are not generalizable to all clinical toxicology scenarios. Adverse effects seem to be proportional to the rate of infusion as well as total dose received. Further safety studies in humans and reporting of adverse events associated with ILE administration at the doses advocated in current clinical toxicology literature are needed.",success
25634667,False,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) are being used together or in close succession in the management of circulatory failure secondary to cardiotoxic drug poisoning. There have been reports of mechanical problems, including fat emulsion agglutination, clogging, increased blood clot formation and even cracking of parts of the machine, in patients concurrently receiving VA-ECMO and ILE as part of parenteral nutrition. To ascertain the adverse effects associated with the combined use of ILE and ECMO in the poisoned patient. PubMed and OVID (1966 to 9 June 2014) and EMBASE (1947 to 9 June 2014) were searched to identify publications relating to studies and/or case reports where ILE had been used at the same time when VA-ECMO was used - 7 were identified. In addition, the abstracts published between 2006 and 2013 inclusive of those from the North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology and the congresses of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists were searched to identify additional cases and 2 were found. Finally all cases posted on lipidrescue.org were reviewed to determine if they related to the use of ILE with VA-ECMO and no new cases were identified. In vitro study. An in vitro study involving the continuous infusion of 20% ILE at 3 mL/h for 24 h demonstrated layering (separation of intact fat emulsion from blood) and agglutination (clumping resulting in little or no flow of fat emulsion through the circuit) in all circuits within 30 min of starting the fat emulsion infusion. An observational study based in 42 centres that regularly used 'fat emulsion' during VA-ECMO treatment reported cracking of stopcocks (the valve which restricts flow in the VA-ECMO tubing) (n = 10, 23.8%); fat emulsion agglutination (n = 11, 26.2%); clogging and associated malfunction of the membrane oxygenator (n = 2, 4.8%); and increased blood clot formation in the circuits (n = 2, 4.8%). In a prospective observational study of 9 neonates on VA-ECMO receiving intravenous nutrition, layering and agglutination were seen in four sets of VA-ECMO tubing and blood clots were found in seven circuits. Nine case reports were identified where ILE was used with VA-ECMO for the management of circulatory failure/instability secondary to cardiotoxic drug poisoning. In two of these case reports, the authors specifically stated that ILE did not cause any mechanical complications with the VA-ECMO; the other seven reports made no comment as to whether there were any complications or not. There is in vitro and clinical evidence that the combined use of ILE and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be associated with fat deposition in the VA-ECMO circuits and increased blood clot formation. Clinicians managing poisoned patients with both of these novel treatment modalities should be aware of these potential complications.",success
25745797,False,"Case Reports;Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,,,,,,True,"β-Adrenergic antagonist toxicity causes cardiovascular collapse often refractory to standard therapy. Alternative therapies include high-dose insulin, lipid emulsion, and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). A 47-year-old man ingested 10 g of metoprolol tartrate in a suicide attempt. Upon emergency department presentation, he was comatose, bradycardic, and hypotensive. Glucagon (14 mg IV) and vasopressor/inotropic support (epinephrine 0.1 μg/[kg min], dobutamine 10 μg/[kg min]) were administered. Despite these therapies, he developed cardiac arrest for 55 minutes, requiring epinephrine (5 mg IV) and vasopressin (40 U IV) with multiple episodes of return of spontaneous circulation. Additional vasopressor administration (vasopressin 0.04 U/min, norepinephrine 0.5 μg/[kg min]) did not improve his hemodynamics. High-dose insulin (250 U IV) and 20% lipid emulsion (100 mL bolus with 200 mL/30 min infusion) were administered, and VA-ECMO was initiated with hemodynamic improvement. His postarrest neurologic examination demonstrated lack of brainstem reflexes and cortical motor response. He awoke 11.5 hours after time of ingestion. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was discontinued at hospital day 3, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 10 with excellent neurologic recovery. A serum metoprolol level measured 25,000 ng/mL (therapeutic 20-340 ng/mL). High-dose insulin has been shown to be beneficial in β-adrenergic antagonist cardiotoxicity. Lipid emulsion is thought to act as a lipid extractor, lowering serum and tissue levels. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used with the above therapies, restoring organ perfusion and allowing intrinsic drug metabolism and elimination. High-dose insulin, lipid emulsion, and VA-ECMO should be considered for refractory cardiac arrest secondary to β-adrenergic antagonist toxicity such as metoprolol.",success
33232574,False,Case Reports;Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"This short communication aims to review the treatment of cardiogenic shock in patients with yew poisoning based on two case reports from our institution, focusing on the use of extracorporeal life support (ECLS). We report two cases of Taxus baccata poisoning treated with ECLS at our institution and review the literature based on a search in PubMed and Google Scholar on the topic of yew poisoning and ECLS. All cases were combined for analysis of demographics, ECLS therapy, and outcome. Case 1: A 35-year-old woman developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia followed by cardiovascular arrest 5 h after orally ingesting a handful of yew needles. Successful resuscitation required ECLS for 72 h due to ongoing cardiac arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. The patient left the hospital without neurological sequelae after 10 days. Case 2: A 30-year-old woman developed refractory cardiac arrhythmias and circulatory arrest. Resuscitation included ECLS for 71 h. T. baccata needles found by gastroscopy confirmed the diagnosis. The patient had no neurologic deficits and was transferred to psychiatry after 11 days. Nine case reports were found and analysed along with our two cases. Five out of the 11 (45%) patients were female. Median (range) age was 28 (19-46) years. T. baccata needles were ingested with a suicidal intention in all patients. Median (range) duration of ECLS was 70 h (24-120 h). Eight (73%) patients had full neurological recovery. Yew poisoning is a differential diagnosis in young psychiatric patients presenting with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and cardiogenic shock. A characteristic cardiac contraction pattern in echocardiography may present a diagnostic clue. The early use of ECLS is a valuable bridge to recovery in most of these patients.",success
31740156,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"Caffeine has been reported as a cause of cardiac arrest after massive overdose. Here, we report the case of a patient with caffeine intoxication, which can cause fatal dysrhythmias and severe hypokalemia. They were successfully treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A 43-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presented to the emergency department after suicidal drug ingestion (caffeine and amitriptyline). Immediately after arrival, she experienced multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation with severe hypokalemia requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and medical therapy. However, conventional treatment was not successful. We instituted ECMO early during resuscitation because prolonged hypokalemia refractory to aggressive potassium replacement precluded the use of antidysrhythmic medications for refractory circulatory compromise with ventricular fibrillation. The use of ECMO provided time to correct hypokalemia (19.3 g potassium) and reduce the caffeine level with hemodialysis. Although she had sustained cardiac arrest, she recovered fully and was discharged home. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Our case indicates the potential effectiveness of ECMO in severely poisoned patients with fatal dysrhythmias. ECMO could provide time for removal of toxic drugs and correction of electrolyte abnormalities.",success
