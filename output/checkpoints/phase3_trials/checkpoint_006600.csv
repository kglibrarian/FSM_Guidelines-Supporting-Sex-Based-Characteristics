All women aged 15-49 years with live births/stillbirths in 1992-2011 were identified from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry linked with the National Patient Registry. First stroke during the study period was identified. Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for antepartum, peripartum and early and late postpartum periods, compared with all other available follow-up time (time before pregnancy and after postpartum) using Poisson regression adjusted for maternal age, education attainment and calendar time. Of 1,124,541 women, 3094 had a first incident stroke (331 occurred during pregnancy or first 12 weeks postpartum), about half having ischaemic stroke. The incidence was 15.0 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval 14.5-15.6) in non-pregnant time. The incidence was lower antepartum (7.3/100,000 person-years, 6.0-8.9; adjusted IRR = 0.7, 0.5-0.8) but higher peripartum (314.4/100,000 person-years, 247.5-399.5; adjusted IRR = 27.3, 21.4-34.9) and early postpartum (64.0/100,000 person-years, 54.1-75.7; adjusted IRR = 5.5, 4.6-6.6). The increased risk in peripartum was more evident for intracerebral haemorrhage than other types of stroke. Overall risk of stroke was low in women of childbearing age, but stroke risk peaks in the peripartum and early postpartum periods.

This study aimed to delineate the risk of cardiovascular diagnoses in the first 24 months after delivery among patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy compared with patients without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This longitudinal population-based study included pregnant individuals with deliveries during 2007 to 2019 in the Maine Health Data Organization's All Payer Claims Data.

Overall annual hemorrhage rate for 149 total hemorrhages during an average of 11 097 patient-years was 1.34%. There were 140 hemorrhages in nonexposed women and 9 hemorrhages in pregnant women, translating to an annual hemorrhage rate of 1.3% in nonpregnant women versus 5.7% in pregnant women (<i>P</i><0.001). Identical analysis for reproductive age patients (15-50) demonstrated a rate of 1.3% versus 7.0% (<i>P</i><0.001). Our results conflict with those from a recent study describing no increased rate of rupture during pregnancy. This difference may reflect unique population attributes influencing brain AVM hemorrhage during pregnancy.",success

A case-crossover design was adopted to calculate the incidence density of bAVM-related haemorrhage among female patients in risk (pregnancy and puerperium) and control (non-pregnancy and non-puerperium) periods, according to four scenarios observed in different populations (scenario I: patients with haemorrhagic bAVM of all ages; scenario II: patients with haemorrhagic bAVM of all ages, with at least one previous pregnancy; scenario III: patients with haemorrhagic bAVM who are of reproductive age (15-45 years); scenario IV: patients with haemorrhagic bAVM of reproductive age (15-45 years), with at least one previous pregnancy. Next, a comprehensive literature aggregation (up to April 2022) was performed for evidence synthesis. Among the 311 female patients with haemorrhagic bAVM, a significant haemorrhage risk during pregnancy and puerperium was found in Scenarios I (relative risk [RR], 2.08; 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.39), II (RR, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.95 to 5.31) and IV (RR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.73 to 4.93); however, a suggestive risk was found in scenario III (RR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.99 to 2.67).

The reference group comprised 411 201 age-matched nulliparous women. The primary analysis was the risk of severe cardiovascular complications within 42 days of cesarean section or vaginal delivery. The secondary analysis evaluated risk factors for cardiovascular complications. In the cesarean section group, 410 (0.20%) had a serious cardiovascular event within 42 days after delivery, and in the vaginal control group the number was 857 (0.09%). The risk of having an adverse cardiovascular event was significantly greater in the cesarean group (OR 2.23, CI 1.98 to 2.51) for all types of cardiovascular events. Risk factors were high BMI, preeclampsia, greater maternal age, tobacco use and acute cesarean delivery. The absolute numbers on severe maternal morbidity after delivery are low. However, since almost half of the world's population are affected and the frequency of elective cesarean section continues to rise, a doubling of the risk for a severe cardiovascular event within 42 days of delivery is important to consider globally.",success

Participants underwent a baseline and annual medical record review, imaging review, and annual surveys to ascertain pregnancies, deliveries, and neurological complications. We collected prospective hemorrhage data on reproductive age women. We calculated prospective hemorrhage rates on childbearing age patients based on the number of hemorrhages occurring post-CM diagnosis during pregnancy and nonpregnancy, divided by the years of follow-up and censored at last follow-up, age 46, or surgery in sporadic-form CM.

This systematic review aimed to synthesize the available literature on the association between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and the long-term risk for maternal stroke. PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL were searched from inception to December 19, 2022. Studies were only included if the following criteria were met: case-control or cohort studies that were conducted with human participants, were available in English, and that measured the exposure of a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, or superimposed preeclampsia) and the outcome of maternal ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. Three reviewers extracted the data and appraised the study quality following the Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines and using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for risk of bias assessment. The primary outcome was any stroke (undifferentiated) and secondary outcomes included ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. The protocol for this systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under identifier CRD42021254660. Of 24 studies included (10,632,808 study participants), 8 studies examined more than 1 outcome of interest. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were significantly associated with any stroke (adjusted risk ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-2.10). Preeclampsia was significantly associated with any stroke (adjusted risk ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-1.97), ischemic stroke (adjusted risk ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-2.06), and hemorrhagic stroke (adjusted risk ratio, 2.77; 95% confidence interval, 2.04-3.75). Gestational hypertension was significantly associated with any stroke (adjusted risk ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.26), ischemic stroke (adjusted risk ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.53), and hemorrhagic stroke (adjusted risk ratio, 2.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-6.98).

Birth and death certificates and <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification</i> (<i>ICD-9-CM</i> and <i>ICD-10-CM</i>) diagnosis codes in hospitalization/emergency department visit data defined HDP, pre-pregnancy hypertension, incident coronary heart disease and stroke, and all-cause mortality. During at least 1 pregnancy of the 433 430 women, 2.3% had pre-pregnancy hypertension with superimposed HDP, 15.7% had no pre-pregnancy hypertension with HDP, and 0.4% had pre-pregnancy hypertension without superimposed HDP, whereas 81.6% had neither condition. Maternal deaths from coronary heart disease, stroke, and all causes totaled 2136. Within 5 years of delivery, pre-pregnancy hypertension, and HDP were associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.21; 95% CI, 1.61-3.03), incident coronary heart disease (HR, 3.79; 95% CI, 3.09-4.65), and incident stroke (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 2.09-4.60).

This study aimed to determine the risk of and time to onset of maternal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes after a pregnancy complicated by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This study included 2,227,711 women, without preexisting chronic hypertension, who delivered during the period 2008 to 2010: 37,043 (1.66%) were diagnosed with preeclampsia, 34,220 (1.54%) were diagnosed with gestational hypertension, and 2,156,448 had normotensive pregnancies. Hospitalizations for chronic hypertension, heart failure, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease were studied. A classical Cox regression was performed to estimate the average effect of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy over 10 years compared with normotensive pregnancy; moreover, an extended Cox regression was performed with a step function model to estimate the effect of the exposure variable in different time intervals: <1, 1 to 3, 3 to 5, and 5 to 10 years of follow-up. The risk of chronic hypertension after a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia was 18 times higher in the first year (adjusted hazard ratio, 18.531; 95% confidence interval, 16.520-20.787) to only 5 times higher at 5 to 10 years after birth (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.921; 95% confidence interval, 4.640-5.218). The corresponding risks of women with gestational hypertension were 12 times higher (adjusted hazard ratio, 11.727; 95% confidence interval, 10.257-13.409]) and 6 times higher (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.854; 95% confidence interval, 5.550-6.176), respectively. For other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes, there was also a significant effect with preeclampsia (heart failure: adjusted hazard ratio, 6.662 [95% confidence interval, 4.547-9.762]; coronary heart disease: adjusted hazard ratio, 3.083 [95% confidence interval, 1.626-5.844]; cerebrovascular disease: adjusted hazard ratio, 3.567 [95% confidence interval, 2.600-4.893]; peripheral arterial disease: adjusted hazard ratio, 4.802 [95% confidence interval, 2.072-11.132]) compared with gestational hypertension in the first year of follow-up. A dose-response effect was evident for the severity of preeclampsia with the averaged 10-year adjusted hazard ratios for developing chronic hypertension after early, preterm, and late preeclampsia being 10, 7, and 6 times higher, respectively. The risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes were the highest in the first year after a birth complicated by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. We found a significant relationship with both the severity of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and the gestational age of onset suggesting a possible dose-response relationship for the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes.

This review aimed to summarize and critically analyze accumulated knowledge on the etiology, risk factors, relevant diagnostic options, and management approach to recurrent pregnancy loss.

We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies assessing hypertension, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, venous thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, dementia, composite cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases, and mortality after 6 weeks postpartum, in women with prior HDP compared with controls. Two authors independently selected and appraised the studies. Article quality was independently assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Random-effect models were used for meta-analysis. Stratified analyses based on years postpartum, severity, and onset of preeclampsia were performed. We included 59 studies for qualitative review, of which 56 were included in quantitative meta-analysis, involving 1,262,726 women with prior HDP and 14,711,054 controls. Women with prior HDP had increased risks of hypertension (relative risk [RR] 3.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.67-4.49), ischemic heart disease (RR 2.06, 95% CI: 1.38-3.08), and heart failure (RR 2.53, 95% CI: 1.28-5.00) later in life, compared with those with normotensive pregnancies. The risk of hypertension was highest during 5 years postpartum (RR 5.34, 95% CI: 2.74-10.39). Compared with normotensive pregnancies, the risk of future CVDs significantly increased in preeclamptic women. A history of HDP is associated with approximately 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of CVDs. Screening for CVDs and their risk factors in women with prior HDP since delivery, especially the first 5 years after delivery is suggested for early detection and appropriate management.

We provide a comprehensive review of studies to quantify the association between gestational hypertension and cardiovascular events in women. Methods and Results We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science in March 2019 for studies examining the association between gestational hypertension and any cardiovascular event. Two reviewers independently assessed the abstracts and full-text articles. Study characteristics and the relative risk (RR) of cardiovascular events associated with gestational hypertension were extracted from the eligible studies. Where appropriate, the estimates were pooled with inverse variance weighted random-effects meta-analysis. A total of 21 studies involving 3 60 1192 women (127 913 with gestational hypertension) were identified. Gestational hypertension in the first pregnancy was associated with a greater risk of overall cardiovascular disease (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.17-1.80) and coronary heart disease (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.23-1.73), but not stroke (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.96-1.65) or thromboembolic events (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73-1.07). Women with 1 or more pregnancies affected by gestational hypertension were at greater risk of cardiovascular disease (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.42-2.31), coronary heart disease (RR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.33-2.51), and heart failure (RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.47-2.13), but not stroke (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.75-2.99).

Unfavorable cardiovascular health, as originally defined by the American Heart Association in 2010 and revised in 2022, is prevalent in reproductive-aged individuals. Significant disparities exist in ideal cardiovascular health by race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography. Because the biological processes leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes begin before conception, interventions focused only during pregnancy may have limited impact on both the pregnant individual and offspring. Therefore, focused attention on the prepregnancy period as a critical life period for optimization of cardiovascular health is needed. This scientific statement applies a life course and intergenerational framework to measure, modify, and monitor prepregnancy cardiovascular health. All clinicians who interact with pregnancy-capable individuals can emphasize optimization of cardiovascular health beginning early in childhood. Clinical trials are needed to investigate prepregnancy interventions to comprehensively target cardiovascular health. Beyond individual-level interventions, community-level interventions must include and engage key stakeholders (eg, community leaders, birthing individuals, families) and target a broad range of antecedent psychosocial and social determinants. In addition, policy-level changes are needed to dismantle structural racism and to improve equitable and high-quality health care delivery because many reproductive-aged individuals have inadequate, fragmented health care before and after pregnancy and between pregnancies (interpregnancy).

Still, time-dependent and long-term consequences of exogenous hormones on stroke risk remains unclear. We examined the association between self-reported oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy use and stroke risk in 257 194 women from the UK Biobank, born between 1939 and 1970. Outcomes included any type of stroke, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Exposures were analyzed as time-varying variables in Cox regression models. During first year of oral contraceptive use, an increased event rate of any stroke was observed (hazard ratio [HR], 2.49 [95% CI, 1.44-4.30]), while the hazards were found to be comparable during remaining years of use (HR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.86-1.14]), compared with nonusers. Similarly, first year of hormone replacement therapy use was associated with higher hazard rates of any stroke (HR, 2.12 [95% CI, 1.66-2.70]), as well as cause-specific stroke, including ischemic stroke (HR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.05-3.57]) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.25-3.78]), which remained increased for any stroke during remaining years of use (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.05-1.31]), and after discontinuation (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.02-1.32]). Oral contraceptive use and hormone replacement therapy were associated with an increased risk of stroke, especially during the first year of use, possibly due to immediate changes in hemostatic balance.

We examined a possible dose-response relation between OCP use and the risk of stroke in young and middle-aged women. <b>Methods:</b> A retrieval of PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed. We selected observational studies that reported odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of stroke in OCP users. A two-stage dose-response analysis was conducted using the random-effects model and the restricted spline model. <b>Results:</b> A total of 6 cohort studies and 12 case-control studies were included, which involved 2,143,174 participants and 11,661 cases of stroke including ischemic stroke (IS), hemorrhagic stroke (HS), and stroke of unknown origin. The pooled ORs of total stroke were 1.19 (95% CI, 1.16-1.23) for every 10-μg increment in estrogen dosage, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.05-1.37) for every 5-years increment in duration of OCP use, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68-0.98) for every 5-years increment in duration of OCP cessation. The ORs of IS were 1.20 (95% CI, 1.17-1.22) in estrogen dosage, 1.24 (95% CI, 1.04-1.49) in duration of OCP use, and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.92) in duration of OCP cessation. The ORs of HS were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04-1.16) in estrogen dosage, 1.13 (95% CI, 0.93-1.36) in duration of OCPs, and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.55-0.92) in duration of OCP cessation. The pooled ORs of total stroke from prospective studies (1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.24) were lower than those from retrospective studies (1.30; 95% CI, 1.01-1.67). <b>Conclusions:</b> The higher estrogen dosage significantly increased the risks of total stroke, IS, and HS, respectively. The longer duration of OCP use significantly increased the risks of total stroke and IS, but its effects on HS risk were marginal. The longer duration of OCP cessation significantly decreased the risks of total stroke, IS, and HS, respectively. These findings affirm the contribution of estrogen dose and duration of OCP use to the increased risk of stroke, which may be critical for the instruction of OCP use and the prevention and management of cerebrovascular diseases.",success

The objective was to identify evidence regarding the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or arterial thromboembolism [stroke or acute myocardial infarction (AMI)] among women using POCs. We searched the PubMed database for all articles published from database inception through January 2016 for studies examining thrombosis among women using POCs. We included studies which examined women with medical conditions associated with thrombosis risk, as well as studies of women in the general population (either without these conditions or who were not specified to have these conditions). Hormonal contraceptives of interest included progestin-only pills (POPs), injectables, implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs). Outcomes of interest included VTE, stroke and AMI. There were 26 articles of good to poor quality that met inclusion criteria; 9 studies examined women with medical conditions and 20 examined women in the general population. Two studies found that, among smokers and women with certain thrombogenic mutations, use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) had elevated odds of VTE compared with nonsmokers or those without mutations, although confidence intervals were wide and overlapped with odds among nonusers. One study found that, among women with previous VTE, use of POCs (including DMPA) was associated with a nonsignificant increased odds of recurrent VTE (all of which were among DMPA users); two other studies that examined POCs other than DMPA did not observe an association with recurrent VTE. Two studies found that use of DMPA among healthy women was also associated with increased odds of VTE.

Acute stroke of any type is an emergency that should prompt immediate coordination of care between obstetric anesthesiologists, stroke neurologists, high-risk obstetricians, nurses, and neonatologists. Historically, guidelines have not addressed the unique situation of maternal stroke, and pregnant women have been excluded from the large stroke trials. More recently, several publications and professional societies have highlighted that pregnant women suspected of having IS or HS should be evaluated for the same therapies as nonpregnant women. Vaginal delivery is generally preferred unless there are obstetric indications for cesarean delivery. Neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia are frequently safer than general anesthesia for cesarean delivery in the patient with a recent stroke.

Earlier surgical menopause (e.g. <45 years) poses additional increased risk of incident CVD events, compared to women with natural menopause at the same age, and HRT use reduced the risk of CVD in women with early surgical menopause. Earlier age at menopause has been linked to an increased risk of CVD mortality and all-cause mortality, but the extent that this risk of CVD varies by type of menopause and the role of postmenopausal HRT use in reducing this risk is unclear. Pooled individual-level data of 203 767 postmenopausal women from 10 observational studies that contribute to the International collaboration for a Life course Approach to reproductive health and Chronic disease Events (InterLACE) consortium were included in the analysis. Postmenopausal women who had reported menopause (type and age of menopause) and information on non-fatal CVD events were included. Type of menopause (natural menopause and surgical menopause) and age at menopause (categorised as <35, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54 and ≥55 years) were exposures of interest. Natural menopause was defined as absence of menstruation over a period of 12 months (no hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy) and surgical menopause as removal of both ovaries. The study outcome was the first non-fatal CVD (defined as either incident coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke) event ascertained from hospital medical records or self-reported. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI for non-fatal CVD events associated with natural menopause and surgical menopause. Compared with natural menopause, surgical menopause was associated with over 20% higher risk of CVD (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.16-1.28). After the stratified analysis by age at menopause, a graded relationship for incident CVD was observed with lower age at menopause in both types of natural and surgical menopause. There was also a significant interaction between type of menopause and age at menopause (P < 0.001). Compared with natural menopause at 50-54 years, women with surgical menopause before 35 (2.55, 2.22-2.94) and 35-39 years (1.91, 1.71-2.14) had higher risk of CVD than those with natural menopause (1.59, 1.23-2.05 and 1.51, 1.33-1.72, respectively). Women who experienced surgical menopause at earlier age (<50 years) and took HRT had lower risk of incident CHD than those who were not users of HRT. Self-reported data on type and age of menopause, no information on indication for the surgery (e.g. endometriosis and fibroids) and the exclusion of fatal CVD events may bias our results. In clinical practice, women who experienced natural menopause or had surgical menopause at an earlier age need close monitoring and engagement for preventive health measures and early diagnosis of CVD. Our findings also suggested that timing of menopause should be considered as an important factor in risk assessment of CVD for women. The findings on CVD lend some support to the position that elective bilateral oophorectomy (surgical menopause) at hysterectomy for benign diseases should be discouraged based on an increased risk of CVD.

However, it is unclear whether the association exists between premature menopause (defined as age at menopause 40 years) or early menopause (defined as age at menopause 40-45 years) and CVD or cardiovascular risk factors. The aim of this review was to comprehensively evaluate and meta-analyze the most reliable evidence about the relationship between menopausal age and the risk of long-term cardiometabolic disease. A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases from inception to October 1, 2022, for titles and abstracts with a restriction to English language papers led to the discovery of the studies.

No difference was found for hypertension in PM or EM women (RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.89-1.07; RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.91-1.04, respectively). Additionally, we also found that PM women, but not EM women, were linked with an increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. However, this is not in line with the conclusion that both PM and EM had a higher risk of total stroke. Women with PM or EM have a higher risk of developing long-term CVD, compared to women with menopause at age >45 years. Therefore, we recommend early lifestyle interventions (e.g., maintaining a healthy lifestyle) and medical treatments (e.g., timely initiation of menopausal hormone therapy) to decrease the risk of cardiometabolic disease in early or premature menopausal women.

For OCs, measures of association are from meta-analyses of observational studies. For HT, these measures are from the Women's Health Initiative, a large randomized trial of HT for chronic disease prevention in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years. Current OC use increases risks of venous thromboembolism and ischemic stroke. However, women of reproductive age are at low baseline risk, so the ARs are small. OC use also increases risk of breast and liver cancer and reduces risk of ovarian, endometrial, and colorectal cancer; the net effect is a modest reduction in total cancer. The Women's Health Initiative results show that HT does not prevent coronary events or overall chronic disease in postmenopausal women as a whole. Subgroup analyses suggest that timing of HT initiation influences the relation between such therapy and coronary risk, and its overall risk-benefit balance, with more favorable effects (on a relative scale) in younger or recently menopausal women than in older women or those further past the menopausal transition. However, even if the RR do not vary by these characteristics, the low absolute baseline risks of younger or recently menopausal women translate into low ARs in this group.

This is an updated version of a Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess effects of long-term HT (at least 1 year's duration) on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, fracture and cognition in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women during and after cessation of treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases to September 2016: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We searched the registers of ongoing trials and reference lists provided in previous studies and systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised double-blinded studies of HT versus placebo, taken for at least 1 year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via the oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or intranasal route. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of the evidence by using GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 studies involving 43,637 women. We derived nearly 70% of the data from two well-conducted studies (HERS 1998; WHI 1998). Most participants were postmenopausal American women with at least some degree of comorbidity, and mean participant age in most studies was over 60 years. None of the studies focused on perimenopausal women.In relatively healthy postmenopausal women (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease), combined continuous HT increased the risk of a coronary event (after 1 year's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 3 and 7 per 1000), venous thromboembolism (after 1 year's use: from 2 per 1000 to between 4 and 11 per 1000), stroke (after 3 years' use: from 6 per 1000 to between 6 and 12 per 1000), breast cancer (after 5.6 years' use: from 19 per 1000 to between 20 and 30 per 1000), gallbladder disease (after 5.6 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) and death from lung cancer (after 5.6 years' use plus 2.4 years' additional follow-up: from 5 per 1000 to between 6 and 13 per 1000).Oestrogen-only HT increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (after 1 to 2 years' use: from 2 per 1000 to 2 to 10 per 1000; after 7 years' use: from 16 per 1000 to 16 to 28 per 1000), stroke (after 7 years' use: from 24 per 1000 to between 25 and 40 per 1000) and gallbladder disease (after 7 years' use: from 27 per 1000 to between 38 and 60 per 1000) but reduced the risk of breast cancer (after 7 years' use: from 25 per 1000 to between 15 and 25 per 1000) and clinical fracture (after 7 years' use: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000) and did not increase the risk of coronary events at any follow-up time.Women over 65 years of age who were relatively healthy and taking continuous combined HT showed an increase in the incidence of dementia (after 4 years' use: from 9 per 1000 to 11 to 30 per 1000). Among women with cardiovascular disease, use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism (at 1 year's use: from 3 per 1000 to between 3 and 29 per 1000). Women taking HT had a significantly decreased incidence of fracture with long-term use.Risk of fracture was the only outcome for which strong evidence showed clinical benefit derived from HT (after 5.6 years' use of combined HT: from 111 per 1000 to between 79 and 96 per 1000; after 7.1 years' use of oestrogen-only HT: from 141 per 1000 to between 92 and 113 per 1000). Researchers found no strong evidence that HT has a clinically meaningful impact on the incidence of colorectal cancer.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy women 50 to 59 years of age who were taking combined continuous HT and 1637 who were taking oestrogen-only HT versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thromboembolism in women taking combined continuous HT: Their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, other differences in risk cannot be excluded, as this study was not designed to have the power to detect differences between groups of women within 10 years of menopause.For most studies, risk of bias was low in most domains. The overall quality of evidence for the main comparisons was moderate. The main limitation in the quality of evidence was that only about 30% of women were 50 to 59 years old at baseline, which is the age at which women are most likely to consider HT for vasomotor symptoms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Women with intolerable menopausal symptoms may wish to weigh the benefits of symptom relief against the small absolute risk of harm arising from short-term use of low-dose HT, provided they do not have specific contraindications. HT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer (such as breast cancer, in women with a uterus). The risk of endometrial cancer among women with a uterus taking oestrogen-only HT is well documented.HT is not indicated for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, nor for prevention of deterioration of cognitive function in postmenopausal women. Although HT is considered effective for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk for whom non-oestrogen therapies are unsuitable. Data are insufficient for assessment of the risk of long-term HT use in perimenopausal women and in postmenopausal women younger than 50 years of age.",success

During the menopausal transition, approximately 50% to 75% of women have hot flashes, night sweats, or both (vasomotor symptoms) and more than 50% have genitourinary symptoms (genitourinary syndrome of menopause [GSM]). Vasomotor symptoms typically last more than 7 years and GSM is often chronic. Efficacious treatments for women with bothersome vasomotor symptoms or GSM symptoms include hormonal and nonhormonal options. Systemic estrogen alone or combined with a progestogen reduces the frequency of vasomotor symptoms by approximately 75%. Oral and transdermal estrogen have similar efficacy. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) were the only hormonal treatments for which clinical trials were designed to examine cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer risk. Compared with placebo, the increased risk of stroke and venous thromboembolism associated with CEE (with or without MPA) and breast cancer (with use of CEE plus MPA) is approximately 1 excess event/1000 person-years. Low-dose CEE plus bazedoxifene is not associated with increased risk of breast cancer (0.25%/year vs 0.23%/year with placebo). Bioidentical estrogens approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (with identical chemical structure to naturally produced estrogens, and often administered transdermally) also are available to treat vasomotor symptoms. For women who are not candidates for hormonal treatments, nonhormonal approaches such as citalopram, desvenlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin, paroxetine, and venlafaxine are available and are associated with a reduction in frequency of vasomotor symptoms by approximately 40% to 65%. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is associated with subjective improvement in GSM symptom severity by approximately 60% to 80%, with improvement in severity by 40% to 80% for vaginal prasterone, and with improvement in severity by 30% to 50% for oral ospemifene. During the menopausal transition, approximately 50% to 75% of women have vasomotor symptoms and GSM symptoms. Hormonal therapy with estrogen is the first-line therapy for bothersome vasomotor symptoms and GSM symptoms, but nonhormonal medications (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine) also can be effective.

Assessments included questionnaires on VMS frequency (0, 1-5, or ≥6 days/2 weeks), physical measures, phlebotomy, and reported CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and revascularization). A subset of events was adjudicated via medical record. Death certificates were obtained. Relationships between baseline VMS or persistent VMS over the follow-up (proportion of visits with frequent VMS) with combined incident nonfatal and fatal CVD were tested in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographics, medication use, and CVD risk factors. Participants experienced 231 CVD events over the follow-up. Women with frequent baseline VMS had an elevated risk of subsequent CVD events (relative to no VMS; ≥6 days: hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI], 1.51 [1.05-2.17], <i>P</i>=0.03; 1-5 days: HR [95% CI], 1.02 [0.75-1.39], <i>P</i>=0.89, multivariable). Women with frequent VMS that persisted over time also had an increased CVD event risk (>33% versus ≤33% of visits: HR [95% CI], 1.77 [1.33-2.35], <i>P</i><0.0001, multivariable). Conclusions Frequent and persistent VMS were associated with increased risk of later CVD events. VMS may represent a novel female-specific CVD risk factor.",success

A growing body of evidence has associated the presence of VMS with future risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. This study aimed to systematically evaluate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the possible association between VMS and the risk for incident CVD. This systematic review and meta-analysis included 11 studies evaluating peri- and postmenopausal women in a prospective design. The association between VMS (hot flashes and/or night sweats) and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, was explored. Associations are expressed as relative risks (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). The risk for incident CVD events in women with and without VMS differed according to the age of participants. Women with VSM younger than 60 years at baseline had a higher risk of an incident CVD event than women without VSM of the same age (RR 1.12, 95 % CI 1.05-1.19, I<sup>2</sup> 0%). Conversely, the incidence of CVD events was not different between women with and without VMS in the age group >60 years (RR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.92-1.01, I<sup>2</sup> 55%). The association between VMS and incident CVD events differs with age. VMS increases the incidence of CVD only in women under 60 years of age at baseline.

For each case of stroke occurring during follow-up, up to four controls were selected from among the cohort members in the risk sets defined by the case. Exposure to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was categorised into oestrogens only, oestrogens plus progestogen, progestogen only, and tibolone. Oestrogens were further subdivided according to the route of administration (oral v transdermal) and dose (high v low). Main outcome measures Rate ratio of stroke associated with current use of oral and transdermal HRT compared with no use. Current use was considered as a prescription whose duration included the index date. There were 15,710 cases of stroke matched to 59 958 controls. The rate of stroke in the cohort was 2.85 per 1000 per year. The adjusted rate ratio of stroke associated with current use of transdermal HRT was 0.95 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.20) relative to no use.

There is mounting evidence that thrombin acts as a powerful modulator of many processes like regulation of vascular tone, permeability, migration and proliferation of VSMC, recruitment of monocytes into the atherosclerotic lesions, induction of diverse pro-inflammatory markers, and all of these are related to the progression of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies in transgenic mice models indicate that the deletion of the natural thrombin inhibitor heparin cofactor II promotes an accelerated atherogenic state. Moreover, the reduction of thrombin activity levels in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, because of the administration of the direct thrombin inhibitor melagatran, attenuates plaque progression and promotes stability in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The combined evidence points to thrombin as a pivotal contributor to vascular pathophysiology. Considering the clinical development of selective anticoagulants including direct thrombin inhibitors, it is a relevant moment to review the different thrombin-induced mechanisms that contribute to the initiation, formation, progression, and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques.",success

We compared orally administered antiplatelet agents (aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dipyridamole) versus anticoagulant agents (coumarins, warfarin, non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants). Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed the risks and benefits of antithrombotic versus antiplatelet therapy using relative measures of effects, such as risk ratios (RR), accompanied with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data extracted included data relating to the study design, patient characteristics, study eligibility, quality, and outcomes. We used GRADE criteria to assess the quality of the evidence. This update identified one additional study for inclusion, adding data for 2305 participants. This addition more than doubled the overall number of patients eligible for the review. In total, we included four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 4187 eligible participants. All studies compared warfarin with aspirin. One RCT additionally compared warfarin with clopidogrel. All included RCTs studied patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.Analysis of all outcomes for warfarin versus aspirin was based on 3663 patients from four RCTs. All-cause mortality was similar for warfarin and aspirin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.13; 4 studies; 3663 participants; moderate quality evidence). Oral anticoagulation was associated with a reduction in non-fatal cardiovascular events, which included non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, peripheral arterial embolism (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.00; 4 studies; 3663 participants; moderate quality evidence). The rate of major bleeding events was twice as high in the warfarin groups (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.78; 4 studies; 3663 participants; moderate quality evidence). We generally considered the risk of bias of the included studies to be low.Analysis of warfarin versus clopidogrel was based on a single RCT (N = 1064). All-cause mortality was similar for warfarin and clopidogrel (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.21; 1 study; 1064 participants; low quality evidence). There were similar rates of non-fatal cardiovascular events (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.45; 1 study; 1064 participants; low quality evidence). The rate of major bleeding events was 2.5 times higher in the warfarin group (RR 2.47, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.91; 1 study; 1064 participants; low quality evidence). Risk of bias for this study can be summarised as low. There is evidence from RCTs to suggest that neither oral anticoagulation with warfarin or platelet inhibition with aspirin is better for mortality in systolic heart failure with sinus rhythm (high quality of the evidence for all-cause mortality and moderate quality of the evidence for non-fatal cardiovascular events and major bleeding events). Treatment with warfarin was associated with a 20% reduction in non-fatal cardiovascular events but a twofold higher risk of major bleeding complications (high quality of the evidence). We saw a similar pattern of results for the warfarin versus clopidogrel comparison (low quality of the evidence). At present, there are no data on the role of oral anticoagulation versus antiplatelet agents in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with sinus rhythm. Also, there were no data from RCTs on the utility of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared to antiplatelet agents in heart failure with sinus rhythm.",success

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of aspirin versus placebo in patients with a moderate estimated risk of a first cardiovascular event. ARRIVE is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study done in seven countries. Eligible patients were aged 55 years (men) or 60 years (women) and older and had an average cardiovascular risk, deemed to be moderate on the basis of the number of specific risk factors. We excluded patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or other bleeding, or diabetes. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a computer-generated randomisation code to receive enteric-coated aspirin tablets (100 mg) or placebo tablets, once daily. Patients, investigators, and others involved in treatment or data analysis were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite outcome of time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack. Safety endpoints were haemorrhagic events and incidence of other adverse events, and were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00501059. Between July 5, 2007, and Nov 15, 2016, 12 546 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive aspirin (n=6270) or placebo (n=6276) at 501 study sites. Median follow-up was 60 months. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary endpoint occurred in 269 (4·29%) patients in the aspirin group versus 281 (4·48%) patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·96; 95% CI 0·81-1·13; p=0·6038). Gastrointestinal bleeding events (mostly mild) occurred in 61 (0·97%) patients in the aspirin group versus 29 (0·46%) in the placebo group (HR 2·11; 95% CI 1·36-3·28; p=0·0007). The overall incidence rate of serious adverse events was similar in both treatment groups (n=1266 [20·19%] in the aspirin group vs n=1311 [20·89%] in the placebo group. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups (n=5142 [82·01%] vs n=5129 [81·72%] in the placebo group). The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was low (n=1050 [16·75%] vs n=850 [13·54%] in the placebo group; p<0·0001). There were 321 documented deaths in the intention-to-treat population (n=160 [2·55%] vs n=161 [2·57%] of 6276 patients in the placebo group). The event rate was much lower than expected, which is probably reflective of contemporary risk management strategies, making the study more representative of a low-risk population. The role of aspirin in primary prevention among patients at moderate risk could therefore not be addressed. Nonetheless, the findings with respect to aspirin's effects are consistent with those observed in the previously published low-risk primary prevention studies. Bayer.",success

To determine whether daily, low-dose aspirin reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events in older Japanese patients with multiple atherosclerotic risk factors. The Japanese Primary Prevention Project (JPPP) was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial. Patients (N = 14,464) were aged 60 to 85 years, presenting with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes mellitus recruited by primary care physicians at 1007 clinics in Japan between March 2005 and June 2007, and were followed up for up to 6.5 years, with last follow-up in May 2012. A multidisciplinary expert panel (blinded to treatment assignments) adjudicated study outcomes. Patients were randomized 1:1 to enteric-coated aspirin 100 mg/d or no aspirin in addition to ongoing medications. Composite primary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes (myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular causes), nonfatal stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic, including undefined cerebrovascular events), and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Secondary outcomes included individual end points. The study was terminated early by the data monitoring committee after a median follow-up of 5.02 years (interquartile range, 4.55-5.33) based on likely futility. In both the aspirin and no aspirin groups, 56 fatal events occurred. Patients with an occurrence of nonfatal stroke totaled 114 in the aspirin group and 108 in the no aspirin group; of nonfatal myocardial infarction, 20 in the aspirin group and 38 in the no aspirin group; of undefined cerebrovascular events, 3 in the aspirin group and 5 in the no aspirin group.

The primary efficacy outcome was the first serious vascular event (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or death from any vascular cause, excluding any confirmed intracranial hemorrhage). The primary safety outcome was the first major bleeding event (i.e., intracranial hemorrhage, sight-threatening bleeding event in the eye, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other serious bleeding).

Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also analyzed. The primary analysis was conducted for cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a per-protocol cohort).

We investigated the incidence of stroke, outcomes after stroke, and the efficacy of ticagrelor focusing on the approved 60 mg twice daily dose for reducing stroke in this population. Patients were followed for a median of 33 months. Stroke events were adjudicated by a central committee. Data from similar trials were combined using meta-analysis. Of 14 112 patients randomly assigned to placebo or ticagrelor 60 mg, 213 experienced a stroke; 85% of these strokes were ischemic.

We stratified meta-analysis by duration of follow-up: short-term (6 to 12 months); medium-term (> 12 to 36 months); and long-term ( > 3 years), and used meta-regression to explore potential treatment effect modifiers. We used GRADE for primary outcomes at 6 to 12 months (the most common follow-up time point).  MAIN RESULTS: This review included 85 trials which randomised 23,430 people with CHD. This latest update identified 22 new trials (7795 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients, with a mean age ranging from 47 to 77 years. In the last decade, the median percentage of women with CHD has increased from 11% to 17%, but females still account for a similarly small percentage of participants recruited overall ( < 15%). Twenty-one of the included trials were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality over the last decade. The median longest follow-up time was 12 months (range 6 months to 19 years). At short-term follow-up (6 to 12 months), exercise-based CR likely results in a slight reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.04; 25 trials; moderate certainty evidence), a large reduction in MI (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 22 trials; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 75, 95% CI 47 to 298; high certainty evidence), and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; 14 trials;  NNTB 12, 95% CI 9 to 21; moderate certainty evidence). Exercise-based CR likely results in little to no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.14; 15 trials; moderate certainty evidence), CABG (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; 20 trials; high certainty evidence), and PCI (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.19; 13 trials; moderate certainty evidence) up to 12 months' follow-up. We are uncertain about the effects of exercise-based CR on cardiovascular hospitalisation, with a wide confidence interval including considerable benefit as well as harm (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.59; low certainty evidence). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity across trials for cardiovascular hospitalisations (I<sup>2</sup> = 53%), and of small study bias for all-cause hospitalisation, but not for all other outcomes. At medium-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; 15 trials), MI (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 12 trials), PCI (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.35; 6 trials), CABG (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 9 trials), and all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 9 trials), a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality was found (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; 5 trials). Evidence is uncertain for difference in risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; 3 trials). At long-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10), exercise-based CR may result in a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; 8 trials) and MI (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 10 trials). Evidence is uncertain for CABG (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.27; 4 trials), and PCI (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20; 3 trials). Meta-regression showed benefits in outcomes were independent of CHD case mix, type of CR, exercise dose, follow-up length, publication year, CR setting, study location, sample size or risk of bias. There was evidence that exercise-based CR may slightly increase HRQoL across several subscales (SF-36 mental component, physical functioning, physical performance, general health, vitality, social functioning and mental health scores) up to 12 months' follow-up; however, these may not be clinically important differences. The eight trial-based economic evaluation studies showed exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This updated Cochrane Review supports the conclusions of the previous version, that exercise-based CR provides important benefits to people with CHD, including reduced risk of MI, a likely small reduction in all-cause mortality, and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation, along with associated healthcare costs, and improved HRQoL up to 12 months' follow-up. Over longer-term follow-up, benefits may include reductions in cardiovascular mortality and MI. In the last decade, trials were more likely to include females, and be undertaken in LMICs, increasing the generalisability of findings. Well-designed, adequately-reported RCTs of CR in people with CHD more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. Trials should explicitly report clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospital admissions, and include validated HRQoL outcome measures, especially over longer-term follow-up, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.",success

Areas focused upon included the current use of HYCR, exercise programming considerations (eligibility and safety, exercise prescription, and patient monitoring), program assessments and outcomes, patient education, step-by-step instructions for billing and insurance reimbursement, patient and provider engagement strategies, and special considerations. A FBCR is the first choice for patient participation in CR, as it is supported by an extensive evidence base demonstrating effectiveness in decreasing cardiac and overall mortality, as well as improving functional capacity and quality of life. However, to attain the CR participation rate goal of 70% set by the Million Hearts Initiative, CR programming will need to be expanded beyond the confines of FBCR.

Although data suggest that new delivery models for CR have safety and efficacy similar to traditional in-person CR, questions remain regarding which participants are most likely to benefit from these models, how and where such programs should be delivered, and their effect on outcomes in diverse populations. In this review, we describe important gaps in evidence, identify relevant research questions, and propose strategies for addressing them. We highlight 4 research priorities: (1) including diverse populations in all CR research; (2) leveraging implementation methodologies to enhance equitable delivery of CR; (3) clarifying which populations are most likely to benefit from virtual and remote CR; and (4) comparing traditional in-person CR with virtual and remote CR in diverse populations using multicenter studies of important clinical, psychosocial, and cost-effectiveness outcomes that are relevant to patients, caregivers, providers, health systems, and payors.

31082266,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based intervention that uses patient education, health behavior modification, and exercise training to improve secondary prevention outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. CR programs reduce morbidity and mortality rates in adults with ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or cardiac surgery but are significantly underused, with only a minority of eligible patients participating in CR in the United States. New delivery strategies are urgently needed to improve participation. One potential strategy is home-based CR (HBCR). In contrast to center-based CR services, which are provided in a medically supervised facility, HBCR relies on remote coaching with indirect exercise supervision and is provided mostly or entirely outside of the traditional center-based setting. Although HBCR has been successfully deployed in the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries, most US healthcare organizations have little to no experience with such programs. The purpose of this scientific statement is to identify the core components, efficacy, strengths, limitations, evidence gaps, and research necessary to guide the future delivery of HBCR in the United States. Previous randomized trials have generated low- to moderate-strength evidence that HBCR and center-based CR can achieve similar improvements in 3- to 12-month clinical outcomes. Although HBCR appears to hold promise in expanding the use of CR to eligible patients, additional research and demonstration projects are needed to clarify, strengthen, and extend the HBCR evidence base for key subgroups, including older adults, women, underrepresented minority groups, and other higher-risk and understudied groups.

The 50 members of the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (ICCPR) and personal contacts facilitated program identification. Overall, 1062 (18.3% program response rate) responses were received from 70/111 (63.1% country response rate) countries in the world with existent CR programs. Of these, 367 (49.1%) programs reported they had stopped CR delivery, and 203 (27.1%) stopped temporarily (mean = 8.3 ± 2.8 weeks). Alternative models were delivered in 322 (39.7%) programs, primarily through low-tech modes (n = 226,19.3%).

Secondary prevention, including cardiac rehabilitation (CR), is crucial to improve risk factors and to reduce disease burden and disability. Accessibility barriers contribute to underutilization of traditional center-based CR programs; therefore, alternative delivery models, including cardiac telerehabilitation (ie, delivery via mobile, smartphone, and/or web-based apps), have been tested. Experimental studies have shown cardiac telerehabilitation to be effective and cost-effective, but there is inadequate evidence about how to translate this research into routine clinical practice. This systematic review aimed to synthesize research evaluating the effectiveness of implementing cardiac telerehabilitation interventions at scale in routine clinical practice, including factors underlying successful implementation processes, and experimental research evaluating implementation-related outcomes. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Global Health databases were searched from 1990 through November 9, 2018, for studies evaluating the implementation of telerehabilitation for the self-management of CHD. Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were hand searched to identify additional studies. Implementation outcomes of interest included acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability. A narrative synthesis of results was carried out. No included studies evaluated the implementation of cardiac telerehabilitation in routine clinical practice. A total of 10 studies of 2250 participants evaluated implementation outcomes, including acceptability (8/10, 80%), appropriateness (9/10, 90%), adoption (6/10, 60%), feasibility (6/10, 60%), fidelity (7/10, 70%), and implementation cost (4/10, 40%), predominantly from the participant perspective. Cardiac telerehabilitation interventions had high acceptance among the majority of participants, but technical challenges such as reliable broadband internet connectivity can impact acceptability and feasibility. Many participants considered telerehabilitation to be an appropriate alternative CR delivery model, as it was convenient, flexible, and easy to access. Participants valued interactive intervention components, such as real-time exercise monitoring and feedback as well as individualized support. The penetration and sustainability of cardiac telerehabilitation, as well as the perspectives of CR practitioners and health care organizations, have received little attention in existing cardiac telerehabilitation research. Experimental trials suggest that participants perceive cardiac telerehabilitation to be an acceptable and appropriate approach to improve the reach and utilization of CR, but pragmatic implementation studies are needed to understand how interventions can be sustainably translated from research into clinical practice. Addressing this gap could help realize the potential impact of telerehabilitation on CR accessibility and participation as well as person-centered, health, and economic outcomes.

To compare the effect of home-based and supervised centre-based cardiac rehabilitation on mortality and morbidity, exercise-capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors in patients with heart disease. We updated searches from the previous Cochrane Review by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO) on 21 September 2016. We also searched two clinical trials registers as well as previous systematic reviews and reference lists of included studies. No language restrictions were applied.

Two review authors independently screened all identified references for inclusion based on pre-defined inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or by involving a third review author. Two authors independently extracted outcome data and study characteristics and assessed risk of bias. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE principles and a Summary of findings table was created. We included six new studies (624 participants) for this update, which now includes a total of 23 trials that randomised a total of 2890 participants undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. Participants had an acute myocardial infarction, revascularisation or heart failure. A number of studies provided insufficient detail to enable assessment of potential risk of bias, in particular, details of generation and concealment of random allocation sequencing and blinding of outcome assessment were poorly reported.No evidence of a difference was seen between home- and centre-based cardiac rehabilitation in clinical primary outcomes up to 12 months of follow up: total mortality (relative risk (RR) = 1.19, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.16; participants = 1505; studies = 11/comparisons = 13; very low quality evidence), exercise capacity (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.13, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.02; participants = 2255; studies = 22/comparisons = 26; low quality evidence), or health-related quality of life up to 24 months (not estimable).

This update supports previous conclusions that home- and centre-based forms of cardiac rehabilitation seem to be similarly effective in improving clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction or revascularisation, or with heart failure. This finding supports the continued expansion of evidence-based, home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes. The choice of participating in a more traditional and supervised centre-based programme or a home-based programme may reflect local availability and consider the preference of the individual patient.

Unfortunately, in traditional center-based CR programs participation and adherence are low. A hybrid model of CR, combining center-based and home-based CR services, has been proposed and is currently being studied as a potential way to help bridge the participation gap, while maintaining the beneficial patient outcomes from CR. However, the ideal composition of a hybrid CR program has not been universally agreed upon. In the present review, we define hybrid CR as any combination of supervised center-based and monitored home-based exercise, where at least two of the core components of CR are addressed. Using this definition, we searched for studies comparing hybrid CR with: (1) traditional center-based CR among CAD patients, (2) usual care among CAD patients, and (3) usual care among HF patients. We found nine studies which fit both our definition and comparison groups. The structure of the hybrid CR programs differed for each study, but typically began with a center-based component lasting 2-11 weeks and transitioned to a home-based component lasting 10-22 weeks, with 3-5 exercise sessions per week composed of either walking (usually with a treadmill) or cycling for 25-35 min at 60-75% maximal heart rate. Patients recorded data from home exercise sessions, via either a digital heart rate monitor or accelerometer, into logbooks which were reviewed by a therapist at specified intervals (often via telephone). Counseling on risk factor management was predominantly provided during the center-based component. In these studies, hybrid CR led to similar short-term outcomes compared to traditional CR in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as increased adherence and reduced delivery costs. Compared with usual care, in patients with CAD, hybrid CR reduced cardiovascular events, and improved lipid profiles, exercise capacity, and HRQoL. In patients with HF, compared with usual care, hybrid CR improved physical function, exercise capacity, and HRQoL.

Forty community dwelling older adults (70-87 years) and 1804 older subjects (67-101 years) participating in the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging were included in this investigation. Sit-to-stand (STS) velocity and muscle power were calculated using the subject's body mass and height, chair height and the time needed to complete five STS repetitions, and compared with those obtained in the leg press exercise using a linear position transducer. In addition, STS performance, physical (gait speed) and cognitive function, sarcopenia (skeletal muscle index (SMI)) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were recorded to assess the association with the STS muscle power values.

Of particular importance is the finding that in those at the high end of the functional spectrum, who reported almost no disability, the performance test scores distinguished a gradient of risk for mortality and nursing home admission. Additionally, within subgroups with identical self-report profiles, there were systematic differences in physical performance related to age and sex.

Screening and testing for sarcopenia may be particularly important among those with chronic disease states. Early recognition of sarcopenia is important because it can provide an opportunity for interventions to reverse or delay the progression of muscle disorder, which may ultimately impact cardiovascular outcomes.

33684215,False,Journal Article;Review,,,,,,,,True,"Multi-compartment body-composition models that divide the body into its multiple constituents are the criterion method for measuring body fat percentage, fat mass, and fat-free mass. However, 2- and 3-compartment body-composition devices such as air displacement plethysmography (ADP), DXA, and bioelectrical impedance devices [bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)] are more commonly used. Accurate measures depend on several assumptions, including constant hydration, body proportion, fat-free body density, and population characteristics. Investigations evaluating body composition in racial and ethnic minorities have observed differences in the aforementioned components between cohorts. Consequently, for racial/ethnic minority populations, estimates of body composition may not be valid. The purpose of this review was to comprehensively examine the validity of common body-composition devices in multi-ethnic samples (samples including >1 race/ethnicity) and in African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American populations. Based on the literature, DXA produces valid results in multi-ethnic samples and ADP is valid for Hispanic and African American males when utilizing race-specific equations. However, for DXA and ADP, there is a need for validity investigations that include larger, more racially diverse samples, specifically including Hispanic/Latinx, Asian, Native American adults, and African-American females. Technology has advanced significantly since initial validity studies were conducted; therefore, conclusions are based on outdated models and software. For BIA, body-composition measures may be valid in a multi-ethnic sample, but the literature demonstrates disparate results between races/ethnicities. For BIA and ADP, the majority of studies have utilized DXA or hydrostatic weighing as the criterion to determine validity; additional studies utilizing a multi-compartment model criterion are essential to evaluate accuracy. Validity studies evaluating more recent technology in larger, more racially/ethnically diverse samples may improve our ability to select the appropriate method to accurately assess body composition in each racial/ethnic population.",success

Body mass index (BMI) and other clinical or commercially available tools for quantifying body fat (BF) such as DXA, MRI, CT, and photonic scanners (3DPS) are often inaccurate, cost prohibitive, or cumbersome to use. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of a novel automated computer vision method, visual body composition (VBC), that uses two-dimensional photographs captured via a conventional smartphone camera to estimate percentage total body fat (%BF). The VBC algorithm is based on a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). The hypothesis is that VBC yields better accuracy than other consumer-grade fat measurements devices. 134 healthy adults ranging in age (21-76 years), sex (61.2% women), race (60.4% White; 23.9% Black), and body mass index (BMI, 18.5-51.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were evaluated at two clinical sites (N = 64 at MGH, N = 70 at PBRC). Each participant had %BF measured with VBC, three consumer and two professional bioimpedance analysis (BIA) systems. The PBRC participants also had air displacement plethysmography (ADP) measured. %BF measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was set as the reference against which all other %BF measurements were compared. To test our scientific hypothesis we run multiple, pair-wise Wilcoxon signed rank tests where we compare each competing measurement tool (VBC, BIA, …) with respect to the same ground-truth (DXA). Relative to DXA, VBC had the lowest mean absolute error and standard deviation (2.16 ± 1.54%) compared to all of the other evaluated methods (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). %BF measured by VBC also had good concordance with DXA (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, CCC: all 0.96; women 0.93; men 0.94), whereas BMI had very poor concordance (CCC: all 0.45; women 0.40; men 0.74). Bland-Altman analysis of VBC revealed the tightest limits of agreement (LOA) and absence of significant bias relative to DXA (bias -0.42%, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.03; p = 0.062; LOA -5.5% to +4.7%), whereas all other evaluated methods had significant (p < 0.01) bias and wider limits of agreement. Bias in Bland-Altman analyses is defined as the discordance between the y = 0 axis and the regressed line computed from the data in the plot. In this first validation study of a novel, accessible, and easy-to-use system, VBC body fat estimates were accurate and without significant bias compared to DXA as the reference; VBC performance exceeded those of all other BIA and ADP methods evaluated. The wide availability of smartphones suggests that the VBC method for evaluating %BF could play an important role in quantifying adiposity levels in a wide range of settings.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04854421.",success

Co-morbid depression and/or anxiety is prevalent in 20% of patients with cardiovascular disease, which may be either transient or chronic. Distress, such as depression, reduces adherence, serves as a barrier to behaviour change and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, and increases the risk that patients drop out of cardiac rehabilitation, impacting on patients' quality of life, risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Hence it is paramount to identify this subset of high-risk patients in clinical practice. This review provides a general overview of the prevalence of selected psychosocial risk factors, their impact on patient-reported and clinical outcomes, and biological and behavioural mechanisms that may explain the association between psychosocial factors and health outcomes. The review also provides recommendations on which self-report screening measures to use to identify patients at high risk due to their psychosocial profile, and the effectiveness of available trials that target these risk factors. Despite challenges and barriers associated with screening of patients combined with appropriate treatment, it is paramount that we treat not only the heart but also the mind in order to improve the quality of care and patient and clinical outcomes.",success

Moreover, it is unknown whether psychological distress based on screeners, validated self-report instruments that efficiently identify those who may require mental health services or additional support, is associated with incident CVD. MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo were searched for studies published 2017-2022, including adults without a past psychiatric diagnosis, who were screened at baseline for depression, anxiety, PTSD, stress, or general mental health symptoms, and followed for &gt;6 mo to determine their risk for incident CVD (ie, atrial fibrillation, acute coronary syndrome, coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, or a composite). A meta-analysis was used to aggregate results to determine whether clinically significant levels of psychological distress were associated with CVD onset. The search identified 28 investigations that represented 658 331 participants (58% women). Fifteen studies had adequate data for the primary meta-analysis, which indicated that those reporting high psychological distress showed a 28% greater risk of incident CVD compared with those with low or no distress. Rapid screening for psychological distress is a helpful and efficient approach to understanding the CVD risk profile of an individual.

Restorative sleep is a pillar of lifestyle medicine influenced by sleep duration, quality, and disorders. Short and long sleep duration are associated with greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Short sleep appears causally related to cardiovascular risk. Long sleep is more strongly predictive of cardiovascular risk, which may be due to comorbidities and other risk factors. Good-quality sleep appears to protect against the increased risk and is independently associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Insomnia, particularly difficulty falling asleep and non-restorative sleep, is associated with an increase in cardiac events. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with cardiac risk and outcomes, which is typically observed in the context of contributing comorbidities. However, treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may not improve prognosis. Further research is needed to understand the causal mechanisms connecting sleep health with CVD and whether modifying sleep can improve outcomes.

Patient mental health, particularly depression, is now recognized as significantly associated with reduced enrollment, participation, attendance, and completion of a cardiac rehabilitation program. More recently, anxiety sensitivity has emerged as an independent construct, related to but distinct from both depression and anxiety. Anxiety sensitivity has been reported to be adversely associated with participation in exercise and, thus, may be important for patients in cardiac rehabilitation. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to conduct a scoping review to summarize the evidence for associations between anxiety sensitivity and cardiovascular disease risk factors, exercise, and clinical outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation. A formal scoping review, following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, was undertaken. Searches of MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, and Scopus databases were conducted, supplemented by hand searches; studies published through December of 2020 were included. The initial screening was based on titles and abstracts and the second stage of screening was based on full text examination. The final search results included 28 studies. Studies reported statistically significant associations between anxiety sensitivity and exercise, cardiovascular disease, and participation in cardiac rehabilitation. Many studies, however, were conducted in non-clinical, community-based populations; there were few studies conducted in cardiovascular disease and cardiac rehabilitation clinical patient populations. Additionally, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the sex-based differences in the complex relationships between anxiety sensitivity, exercise and cardiac rehabilitation.

Psychological symptoms are prevalent for people with CHD, and many psychological treatments are offered following cardiac events or procedures with the aim of improving health and outcomes. This is an update of a Cochrane systematic review previously published in 2011. To assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions (alone or with cardiac rehabilitation) compared with usual care (including cardiac rehabilitation where available) for people with CHD on total mortality and cardiac mortality; cardiac morbidity; and participant-reported psychological outcomes of levels of depression, anxiety, and stress; and to explore potential study-level predictors of the effectiveness of psychological interventions in this population. We updated the previous Cochrane Review searches by searching the following databases on 27 April 2016: CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), and CINAHL (EBSCO). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions compared to usual care, administered by trained staff, and delivered to adults with a specific diagnosis of CHD. We selected only studies estimating the independent effect of the psychological component, and with a minimum follow-up of six months. The study population comprised of adults after: a myocardial infarction (MI), a revascularisation procedure (coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)), and adults with angina or angiographically defined coronary artery disease (CAD). RCTs had to report at least one of the following outcomes: mortality (total- or cardiac-related); cardiac morbidity (MI, revascularisation procedures); or participant-reported levels of depression, anxiety, or stress. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of all references for eligibility. A lead review author extracted study data, which a second review author checked. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. This review included 35 studies which randomised 10,703 people with CHD (14 trials and 2577 participants added to this update). The population included mainly men (median 77.0%) and people post-MI (mean 65.7%) or after undergoing a revascularisation procedure (mean 27.4%). The mean age of participants within trials ranged from 53 to 67 years. Overall trial reporting was poor, with around a half omitting descriptions of randomisation sequence generation, allocation concealment procedures, or the blinding of outcome assessments. The length of follow-up ranged from six months to 10.7 years (median 12 months). Most studies (23/35) evaluated multifactorial interventions, which included therapies with multiple therapeutic components. Ten studies examined psychological interventions targeted at people with a confirmed psychopathology at baseline and two trials recruited people with a psychopathology or another selecting criterion (or both). Of the remaining 23 trials, nine studies recruited unselected participants from cardiac populations reporting some level of psychopathology (3.8% to 53% with depressive symptoms, 32% to 53% with anxiety), 10 studies did not report these characteristics, and only three studies excluded people with psychopathology.Moderate quality evidence showed no risk reduction for total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.05; participants = 7776; studies = 23) or revascularisation procedures (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.11) with psychological therapies compared to usual care. Low quality evidence found no risk reduction for non-fatal MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.05), although there was a 21% reduction in cardiac mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98). There was also low or very low quality evidence that psychological interventions improved participant-reported levels of depressive symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.15; GRADE = low), anxiety (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.09; GRADE = low), and stress (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.24; GRADE = very low).There was substantial statistical heterogeneity for all psychological outcomes but not clinical outcomes, and there was evidence of small-study bias for one clinical outcome (cardiac mortality: Egger test P = 0.04) and one psychological outcome (anxiety: Egger test P = 0.012). Meta-regression exploring a limited number of intervention characteristics found no significant predictors of intervention effects for total mortality and cardiac mortality. For depression, psychological interventions combined with adjunct pharmacology (where deemed appropriate) for an underlying psychological disorder appeared to be more effective than interventions that did not (β = -0.51, P = 0.003). For anxiety, interventions recruiting participants with an underlying psychological disorder appeared more effective than those delivered to unselected populations (β = -0.28, P = 0.03). This updated Cochrane Review found that for people with CHD, there was no evidence that psychological treatments had an effect on total mortality, the risk of revascularisation procedures, or on the rate of non-fatal MI, although the rate of cardiac mortality was reduced and psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, or stress) were alleviated; however, the GRADE assessments suggest considerable uncertainty surrounding these effects. Considerable uncertainty also remains regarding the people who would benefit most from treatment (i.e. people with or without psychological disorders at baseline) and the specific components of successful interventions. Future large-scale trials testing the effectiveness of psychological therapies are required due to the uncertainty within the evidence. Future trials would benefit from testing the impact of specific (rather than multifactorial) psychological interventions for participants with CHD, and testing the targeting of interventions on different populations (i.e. people with CHD, with or without psychopathologies).",success

HIIT involves alternating periods of high intensity aerobic exercise with light recovery exercise or no exercise, allowing for greater physiological stimulus and adaptation than moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) for cardiorespiratory fitness and other cardiometabolic processes. However, there is no universal criteria or framework for the prescription and monitoring of HIIT in clinical populations, and safety concerns remain a common barrier for implementing HIIT as standard care. Historically, exercise intensity has been prescribed using heart rate (HR) targets derived from either a predicted maximal HR (HR<sub>max</sub>) or from an attempt to objectively measure HR<sub>max</sub>. However, using this approach alone has a number of limitations. Here we provide guidelines to improve the delivery of HIIT in cardiometabolic populations using 1) a framework for HIIT prescription using a combination of objective and subjective measures of exercise intensity, and 2) clinical considerations for assessment and monitoring to maximize patient safety. The framework involves an individualized step-by-step process to calculate, validate, and calibrate HR target zones for HIIT training to allow for appropriate workload prescription and progression.

Step counting devices (accelerometers and pedometers) offer an opportunity to monitor daily ambulatory activity; however, an appropriate translation of public health guidelines in terms of steps/day is unknown. Therefore this review was conducted to translate public health recommendations in terms of steps/day. Normative data indicates that 1) healthy older adults average 2,000-9,000 steps/day, and 2) special populations average 1,200-8,800 steps/day. Pedometer-based interventions in older adults and special populations elicit a weighted increase of approximately 775 steps/day (or an effect size of 0.26) and 2,215 steps/day (or an effect size of 0.67), respectively. There is no evidence to inform a moderate intensity cadence (i.e., steps/minute) in older adults at this time. However, using the adult cadence of 100 steps/minute to demark the lower end of an absolutely-defined moderate intensity (i.e., 3 METs), and multiplying this by 30 minutes produces a reasonable heuristic (i.e., guiding) value of 3,000 steps. However, this cadence may be unattainable in some frail/diseased populations. Regardless, to truly translate public health guidelines, these steps should be taken over and above activities performed in the course of daily living, be of at least moderate intensity accumulated in minimally 10 minute bouts, and add up to at least 150 minutes over the week. Considering a daily background of 5,000 steps/day (which may actually be too high for some older adults and/or special populations), a computed translation approximates 8,000 steps on days that include a target of achieving 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and approximately 7,100 steps/day if averaged over a week. Measured directly and including these background activities, the evidence suggests that 30 minutes of daily MVPA accumulated in addition to habitual daily activities in healthy older adults is equivalent to taking approximately 7,000-10,000 steps/day.

The improvement in 6-min walk distance at 2 months was significantly greater in the SMART-CR/SP group (from 489·2 m [99·4] at baseline to 539·1 m [68·0]) than in the control group (from 485·0 m [93·5] at baseline to 517·8 m [74.6]), with an adjusted mean difference of 20·64 m (95% CI 7·50-33·77; p=0·034). This improvement was maintained at 6 months (mean 6-min walk distance 543·4 m [67·5] in the SMART-CR/SP group vs 523·5 m [60·2] in the control group), with a mean between-group difference of 22·29 m (8·19-36·38; p=0·027). No adverse events or SMART-CR/SP programme-related safety issues were reported by participants during the study. SMART-CR/SP was found to be a cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention service model with high efficacy and accessibility and to be easy to use.

A major contributing factor for poor blood pressure control, besides inadequate diuretic therapy, is failure of antihypertensive agents to inhibit the sympathetic nervous system effectively. Consequently, alternative device-driven approaches have been developed. Recent technical advances targeting renal sympathetic nerves, that is, renal denervation therapy, are the focus of more invasive therapies to treat resistant hypertension. Encouraging results from the SYMPLICITY HTN-2 trial, regarding efficacy and safety of renal denervation therapy, were countered by disappointing efficacy results of SYMPLICITY HTN-3.

Eligible patients were drug-naive or discontinued their antihypertensive medications. Patients with an office systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater and less than 180 mm Hg, office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or greater, and a mean 24-h ambulatory SBP of 140 mm Hg or greater and less than 170 mm Hg at second screening underwent renal angiography and were randomly assigned to renal denervation or sham control. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing blood pressure were blinded to randomisation assignments. The primary endpoint, change in 24-h blood pressure at 3 months, was compared between groups. Drug surveillance was done to ensure patient compliance with absence of antihypertensive medication. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population.

Eligible patients aged 18-75 years received indapamide 1·5 mg, ramipril 10 mg (or irbesartan 300 mg), and amlodipine 10 mg daily for 4 weeks to confirm treatment resistance by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before randomisation. Patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either renal denervation plus an SSAHT regimen (renal denervation group) or the same SSAHT alone (control group). The randomisation sequence was generated by computer, and stratified by centres. For SSAHT, after randomisation, spironolactone 25 mg per day, bisoprolol 10 mg per day, prazosin 5 mg per day, and rilmenidine 1 mg per day were sequentially added from months two to five in both groups if home blood pressure was more than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg. The primary endpoint was the mean change in daytime systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months as assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The primary endpoint was analysed blindly. The safety outcomes were the incidence of acute adverse events of the renal denervation procedure and the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01570777. Between May 22, 2012, and Oct 14, 2013, 1416 patients were screened for eligibility, 106 of those were randomly assigned to treatment (53 patients in each group, intention-to-treat population) and 101 analysed because of patients with missing endpoints (48 in the renal denervation group, 53 in the control group, modified intention-to-treat population). The mean change in daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure at 6 months was -15·8 mm Hg (95% CI -19·7 to -11·9) in the renal denervation group and -9·9 mm Hg (-13·6 to -6·2) in the group receiving SSAHT alone, a baseline-adjusted difference of -5·9 mm Hg (-11·3 to -0·5; p=0·0329). The number of antihypertensive drugs and drug-adherence at 6 months were similar between the two groups. Three minor renal denervation-related adverse events were noted (lumbar pain in two patients and mild groin haematoma in one patient). A mild and similar decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 6 months was observed in both groups. In patients with well defined resistant hypertension, renal denervation plus an SSAHT decreases ambulatory blood pressure more than the same SSAHT alone at 6 months. This additional blood pressure lowering effect may contribute to a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity if maintained in the long term after renal denervation. French Ministry of Health.",success

A total of 24 patients with office SBP at least 150 mmHg and 24-h SBP at least 140 mmHg despite receiving at least three full-dose antihypertensive drugs, one a diuretic, but without aldosterone antagonists, were randomized to receive RDN or spironolactone (50 mg) as add-on therapy. Primary endpoint was change in 24-h SBP at 6 months. Comparisons between treatment groups were performed using generalized linear models adjusted by age, sex, and baseline values. Spironolactone was more effective than RDN in reducing 24-h SBP and 24-h DBP: mean baseline-adjusted differences between the two groups were -17.9 mmHg (95%CI -30.9 to -4.9); P = 0.010 and -6.6 mmHg (95%CI -12.9 to -0.3); P = 0.041, for 24-h SBP and 24-h DBP, respectively.

This expert group proposes that RDN is an adjunct treatment option in uncontrolled resistant hypertension, confirmed by ambulatory BP measurements, despite best efforts at lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. RDN may also be used in patients who are unable to tolerate antihypertensive medications in the long term. A shared decision-making process is a key feature and preferably includes a patient who is well informed on the benefits and limitations of the procedure. The decision-making process should take (i) the patient's global cardiovascular (CV) risk and/or (ii) the presence of hypertension-mediated organ damage or CV complications into account. Multidisciplinary hypertension teams involving hypertension experts and interventionalists evaluate the indication and facilitate the RDN procedure. Interventionalists require expertise in renal interventions and specific training in RDN procedures.

In addition to the main renal arteries, branch vessels are also denervated in more contemporary studies. Accurate and reliable imaging in renal denervation patients is critical for long-term safety surveillance due to the small risk of renal artery stenosis that may occur after the procedure. This review summarizes three common non-invasive imaging modalities: Doppler ultrasound (DUS), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). DUS is the most widely used owing to cost considerations, ease of use, and the fact that it is less invasive, avoids ionizing radiation exposure, and requires no contrast media use. Renal angiography is used to determine if renal artery stenosis is present when non-invasive imaging suggests renal artery stenosis. We compiled data from prior renal denervation studies as well as the more recent SPYRAL-HTN OFF MED Study and show that DUS demonstrates both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting renal stenosis de novo and in longitudinal assessment of renal artery patency after interventions. In the context of clinical trials DUS has been shown, together with the use of the baseline angiogram, to be effective in identifying stenosis in branch and accessory arteries and merits consideration as the main screening imaging modality to detect clinically significant renal artery stenosis after renal denervation and this is consistent with guidelines from the recent European Consensus Statement on Renal Denervation.",success

RDN normalized BP in hypertensive CKD sheep such that BP was similar to that of the normotensive sheep with intact nerves. Glomerular filtration rate decreased by ≈22% in CKD sheep with intact nerves but increased ≈26% in hypertensive CKD-RDN sheep by 30 months.

The remaining attributes, in decreasing order, were duration of effect, whether treatment was interventional, number of daily pills, risk of vascular injury, and risk of drug side effects. Risk of access site pain did not influence choice. In general, respondents preferred noninterventional over interventional treatments, yet only a 2.3 mm Hg reduction in office systolic BP was required to offset this preference.

Our study assesses these disparities in mortality after stroke between rural and urban areas across the United States (US). We analyzed the CDC data on deaths attributed to cerebrovascular disease from 1999 to 2020. Data was categorized into rural and urban regions for comparative purposes. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) were computed using the direct method, allowing us to examine the ratios of rural to urban deaths for the cumulative population and among demographic subpopulations. Linear regression models were used to assess temporal changes in mortality ratios over the study period, yielding beta-coefficients (β). There was a total of 628,309 stroke deaths in rural regions and 2,556,293 stroke deaths within urban regions. There were 1.13 rural deaths for each one urban death per 100,000 population in 1999 and 1.07 in 2020 (β = -0.001, p<sub>trend</sub> = 0.41). The rural-urban mortality ratio in Hispanic populations decreased from 1.32 rural deaths for each urban death per 100,000 population in 1999 to 0.85 in 2020 (β = -0.011, p<sub>trend</sub> < 0.001). For non-Hispanic populations, mortality remained stagnant with 1.12 rural deaths for each urban death per 100,000 population in 1999 and 1.07 in 2020 (β = -0.001, p<sub>trend</sub> = 0.543). Regionally, the Southern US exhibited the highest disparity with a urban-rural mortality ratio of 1.19, followed by the Northeast (1.13), Midwest (1.04), and West (1.01).

These constructs are often overlooked and undertreated yet can be as devastating as the physical, functional, and cognitive consequences after stroke. This scientific statement aims to evaluate 5 important aspects of psychosocial health (depression, stress, anxiety, fatigue, and quality of life) after a stroke to provide a framework for related nursing care across the poststroke continuum. A narrative review of the literature published from 2018 to 2023 was conducted with databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, PsychInfo/EBSCOHost, PsychArticles, CINHAL, and the Cochrane Library. Findings reveal a gap in evidence-based nursing interventions for addressing poststroke psychosocial needs. Critical strategies for shaping therapeutic nursing care include enhanced screening with validated tools; educating stroke survivors, families, and staff on symptom recognition, prevention, and treatment; and ensuring appropriate pharmacological management and access to psychological and psychosocial interventions, including referrals to social services and other essential support systems. Care should be comprehensive and interdisciplinary. Nurse-led research can benefit from more inclusive inclusion, including individuals with recurrent strokes and preexisting psychosocial conditions, focusing on the impact of structural racism and care disparities and expanding evidence-based nursing interventions. Although there is limited high-level evidence on the nursing care for patients with suboptimal psychosocial health after stroke, nurses have a crucial role in addressing these needs.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the application of that methodology, using data publicly available online, to simulate the supply of and requirements for midwives, nurses, and physicians in the 32 high-income member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) up to 2030. A model combining a stock-and-flow approach to simulate the future supply of each profession in each country-adjusted according to levels of HRH participation and activity-and a needs-based approach to simulate future HRH requirements was used. Most of the data to populate the model were obtained from the OECD's online indicator database. Other data were obtained from targeted internet searches and documents gathered as part of the companion paper. Relevant recent measures for each model parameter were found for at least one of the included countries. In total, 35% of the desired current data elements were found; assumed values were used for the other current data elements. Multiple scenarios were used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the simulations to different assumed future values of model parameters. Depending on the assumed future values of each model parameter, the simulated HRH gaps across the included countries could range from shortfalls of 74 000 midwives, 3.2 million nurses, and 1.2 million physicians to surpluses of 67 000 midwives, 2.9 million nurses, and 1.0 million physicians by 2030. Despite important gaps in the data publicly available online and the short time available to implement it, this paper demonstrates the basic feasibility of a more comprehensive, population needs-based approach to estimating HRH supply and requirements than most of those currently being used. HRH planners in individual countries, working with their respective stakeholder groups, would have more direct access to data on the relevant planning parameters and would thus be in an even better position to implement such an approach.",success

Current care provision in Saudi Arabia is below international recommendations, and with increasing patient numbers, variable access to new therapies, and sub-optimal co-ordination of staff, the Kingdom's Ministry of Health has prioritised strategies to develop stroke care. Our objective was to use local epidemiological data to predict stroke incidence and to combine this with international staffing recommendations to estimate future staff requirements and their costs over a 10-year period. We researched existing stroke services and staff availability within Saudi Arabia to establish current provision, undertook epidemiological modelling to predict stroke incidence, and used international staffing recommendations for acute and rehabilitation services to develop a care pathway to provide state-of-the-art stroke services. This information was used to determine the additional staff requirements, and their costs, across the Kingdom. Our research concluded that current staff numbers and services are inadequate to cope with the projected increase in the number of stroke cases. In order to provide acute and rehabilitation services which use the latest technologies, re-organisation of existing staff and services would be required, together with significant investment in new staff across several disciplines. An estimated additional 43.8 full-time equivalent stroke neurologists would be required, plus 53.5 full-time equivalent interventional neuroradiologists in addition to expansion of occupational therapy and psychology services. The total cost of additional staff over 10 years was estimated to be 862 390 778 Saudi Riyals ($229 970 874).

The review highlights the critical role of APNs in improving stroke care, especially in the pre-intervention phase. Their clinical expertise, patient-centered approach and collaboration can transform stroke care. Integrating APNs into stroke care teams is essential for better management and outcomes in light of the increasing stroke burden. Healthcare institutions should integrate APNs to enhance pre-intervention stroke care, improve diagnostic accuracy and expedite treatment. APNs can prioritise patient-centric care, including assessments, coordination and education. Medication reconciliation, timely rehabilitation referrals and lifestyle modifications for secondary stroke prevention are crucial. Implementing advanced practice nursing frameworks ensures successful APN integration, leading to improved stroke care and better patient outcomes in response to the growing stroke burden.

Of the thrombolyzed patients, 4150 (51.7%) were treated with TM, while 3873 (48.3%) were not. The mean age of TM and NTM cohorts was 70.45 ± 4.68 and 70.42 ± 4.63, respectively (p > 0.05). Mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores were comparable, with the TM group reporting a non-significantly higher mean (11.89 ± 3.29.6 vs. 11.13 ± 3.65, p > 0.05). No significant difference in outcomes was found for symptoms onset-to-intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (ivtPA) times (144.09 ± 18.87 vs. 147.18 ± 25.97, p = 0.632) and door-to-needle times (73.03 ± 20.04 vs. 65.91 ± 25.96, p = 0.321). Modified Rankin scale scores (0-2) were evaluated, and no significant difference was detected between cohorts (odds ratio (OR): 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-1.29, p = 0.500).

In developing countries, the inequality between urban and rural health services is a serious problem, of which the shortage of qualified healthcare providers is the major cause of the unavailability and low quality of healthcare in rural areas. Some studies have shown that the application of computer-assisted or AI medical techniques could improve healthcare outcomes in rural areas of developing countries. Therefore, the development of suitable medical AI technology for rural areas is worth discussing and probing. <b>Methods:</b> This article reviews and discusses the literature concerning the prospects of medical AI technology, the inequity of healthcare, and the application of computer-assisted or AI medical techniques in rural areas of developing countries. <b>Results:</b> Medical AI technology not only could improve physicians' efficiency and quality of medical services, but other health workers could also be trained to use this technique to compensate for the lack of physicians, thereby improving the availability of healthcare access and medical service quality. This article proposes a multilevel medical AI service network, including a frontline medical AI system (basic level), regional medical AI support centers (middle levels), and a national medical AI development center (top level). <b>Conclusion:</b> The promotion of medical AI technology in rural areas of developing countries might be one means of alleviating the inequality between urban and rural health services.

In this study, we investigated the promptness and reliability of a real-time medical record input assistance system with voice artificial intelligence (RMIS-AI) and compared it to the manual method for triage tasks in the emergency department. From June 4, 2021, to September 12, 2021, RMIS-AI, using a machine learning engine trained with 1717 triage cases over 6 months, was prospectively applied in clinical practice in a triage unit. We analyzed a total of 1063 triage tasks performed by 19 triage nurses who agreed to participate. The primary outcome was the time for participants to perform the triage task. The median time for participants to perform the triage task was 204 (IQR 155, 277) seconds by RMIS-AI and 231 (IQR 180, 313) seconds using manual method; this difference was statistically significant (P<.001). Most variables required for entry in the triage note showed a higher record completion rate by the manual method, but in the recording of additional chief concerns and past medical history, RMIS-AI showed a higher record completion rate than the manual method. Categorical variables entered by RMIS-AI showed less accuracy compared with continuous variables, such as vital signs. RMIS-AI improves the promptness in performing triage tasks as compared to using the manual input method.

The World Health Organization estimates that there are ≈236 000 deaths due to drowning worldwide each year. Significant efforts have focused on creating systems to prevent drowning, but an average of 4000 fatal and 8000 nonfatal drownings still occur annually in the United States-likely an underestimate. Drowning generally progresses from initial respiratory arrest due to submersion-related hypoxia to cardiac arrest; thus, it can be challenging to distinguish respiratory arrest from cardiac arrest because pulses are difficult to accurately palpate within the recommended 10-second window. Therefore, resuscitation from cardiac arrest attributable to this specific circumstance must focus on restoring breathing as much as it does circulation. Resuscitation from drowning may begin with in-water rescue breathing when safely provided by rescuers trained in the technique and should continue with chest compressions, in keeping with basic life support guidelines, once the drowned individual and the rescuer are in a safe environment (eg, dry land, a boat). This focused update incorporates systematic reviews from 2021 to 2023 performed by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation related to the resuscitation of drowning.

In another case of a 9-year-old girl, recurrent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia were associated with Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve. Chest thump was successful in terminating supraventricular tachycardia but induced a short run of ventricular tachycardia which terminated itself and was then followed by sinus rhythm. It is concluded that even a slight precordial thump implies undetermined risks in the acute management of supraventricular tachycardia in children and should therefore be abandoned in favour of other methods.",success

Patients were randomized to receive either interposed abdominal compression-CPR or standard CPR. The two end points studied were return of spontaneous circulation and 24-hour survival. In addition, we studied the complications associated with interposed abdominal compression-CPR. Sixty-nine men and 74 women with a mean age of 64 years (range, 19-97 years) were studied. The overall rate of return of spontaneous circulation was 38%. Return of spontaneous circulation was significantly greater in the group receiving interposed abdominal compression-CPR compared with the group receiving standard CPR (49% versus 28%, p = 0.01). At 24 hours, there was a significantly greater number of patients alive in the experimental group than in the control group (33% versus 13%, p = 0.009). We found no complication directly related to the procedure of interposed abdominal compression in a small subset of patients who died and underwent necropsy.

During the study period, first-dose IM adrenaline was administered to 99 patients (December 1, 2019-February 8, 2021). IM adrenaline was given a median of 12.2 min (95% CI 11.4-13.1 min) after the PSAP call receipt compared to 15.3 min for the IV route (95% CI 14.6-16.0 min) and 15.3 min for the IO route (95% CI 14.9-15.7 min) with a time savings of 3 min (95% CI 2-4 min). Rates of survival to hospital discharge appeared similar between groups: 10% for IM, 8% for IV and 7% for IO. However, results related to survival were underpowered for statistical comparison. Within the limitations of a small sample size and before-and-after design, first-dose IM adrenaline was feasible and reduced the time to adrenaline administration.",success

Mechanical ventilation of patients with severe asthma is difficult due to the complex pathophysiology resulting from severe bronchospasm and dynamic hyperinflation. Life-threatening complications of traditional ventilation strategies in asthma exacerbations include the development of systemic hypotension from hyperinflation, air trapping, and pneumothoraces. Optimizing pharmacologic techniques and ventilation strategies is crucial to treat the underlying bronchospasm. Despite optimal pharmacologic management and mechanical ventilation, the mortality rate of patients with severe asthma in intensive care units is 8%, suggesting a need for advanced non-pharmacologic therapies, including extracorporeal life support (ECLS). This review focuses on the pathophysiology of acute asthma exacerbations, ventilation management including non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), the pharmacologic management of acute asthma, and ECLS.

MP, which refers to the energy associated with the mechanical forces involved in breathing and the functioning of the respiratory system, was calculated using a mathematical formula. Safety was evaluated based on the incidence of complications. After 12 hours of ECMO, we achieved a correction of respiratory acidosis, a significant decrease in all ventilatory parameters, and a reduction in MP ranging from 52.8% to 89%. There was one mortality. Among the five surviving patients, all except one, who required a tracheostomy, had a high VFD score, with a mode of 26 days, demonstrating a reduction in ventilation time.

Noninvasive ventilation may prevent the need for endotracheal intubation in selected patients. For patients who are intubated and undergo mechanical ventilation, a strategy that prioritizes avoidance of ventilator-related complications over correction of hypercapnia was first proposed 30 years ago and has become the preferred approach. Excessive pulmonary hyperinflation is a major cause of hypotension and barotrauma. An appreciation of the key determinants of hyperinflation is essential to rational ventilator management. Standard therapy for patients with asthma undergoing mechanical ventilation consists of inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and drugs used to facilitate controlled hypoventilation. Nonconventional interventions such as heliox, general anesthesia, bronchoscopy, and extracorporeal life support have also been advocated for patients with fulminant asthma but are rarely necessary. Immediate mortality for patients who are mechanically ventilated for acute severe asthma is very low and is often associated with out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest before intubation.

Prolongation of expiratory time decreases dynamic hyperinflation in patients with status asthmaticus, as evidenced by a reduction in plateau airway pressure, but the magnitude of this effect is relatively modest when baseline minute ventilation is < or = 10 L/min, because of the low end-expiratory flow rates. Since flow progressively decreases throughout expiration, the reduction in dynamic hyperinflation resulting from a given prolongation of expiratory time will depend on the baseline respiratory rate (i.e., less reduction in dynamic hyperinflation at a lower respiratory rate).

In a multivariate analysis, sum of ST-segment deviations in all leads >1500 μV (odds ratio 3.7, 95% confidence interval 1.45 to 9.41, p = 0.006) before PCI remained an independent predictor of rVF. In-hospital mortality was 18.3% in the rVF group and 3.3% in the group without VF (p <0.001), but rVF was not an independent predictor of in-hospital death. In conclusion, the magnitude of ST-segment elevation before PCI for STEMI independently predicts rVF and should be considered in periprocedural arrhythmic risk assessment. Despite higher in-hospital mortality in patients with rVF, rVF itself has no independent prognostic value for prognosis.",success

These patients are typically transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) only after primary PCI, whereas during the thrombolytic era, patients were first admitted to CCU before reperfusion. The incidence, timing and setting of complications from symptom onset to hospital discharge in 689 consecutive AMI patients undergoing PCI were evaluated. Ventricular fibrillation occurred in 11% of patients, and most episodes (94.7%) occurred before or during PCI. Of all patients, 6.3% developed complete atrioventricular block (CAVB), and in 86.3% of these cases, the CAVB occurred before or during PCI; in 94.5%, a CAVB resolution occurred in the catheterization laboratory (CL). Thirty-one patients (4.5%) had impending shock on admission to the CL. Cardiogenic shock developed in 2 9 patients (4.2%), mostly in the prehospital phase or in the CL. Only four patients (less than 1%) developed cardiogenic shock later during their hospital course. Similarly, circulatory and ventilatory support, as well as temporary pacing and cardiac defibrillation, were used mostly in the prehospital phase or in the CL. During the CCU stay, 45 patients (6.5%) had hemorrhagic or vascular complications, and the incidence of post-PCI ischemia and early reocclusion of the culprit vessel were low (2.1% and 0.6%, respectively). Thus, cardiac complications usually associated with AMI were observed mainly before hospital admission or in the CL during the reopening of the target vessel. These complications were rarely observed after a successful PCI. For AMI patients, the CL is not only the site of PCI, it is also where most life-threatening cardiac complications are observed and treated.",success

Although patients with VT/VF had a higher incidence of bradyarrhythmias, hypotension, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and endotracheal intubation in the catheterization laboratory, their in-hospital and one-year adverse outcomes were similar to those of the cohort without these arrhythmias. Our findings suggest that the incidence of VT/VF during primary PCI is low, indicating that these arrhythmias do not influence PCI success or in-hospital or one-year outcomes.

Long-term survival was compared with that of a matched cohort of patients who did not have an arrest during catheterization and a matched cohort from the general Minnesota population. Over the 11-year period, the overall incidence of CPR was 21.9 per 10,000 procedures. This rate decreased from 33.9 per 10,000 before 1995 to 13.1 per 10,000 after 1995. Overall survival to hospital discharge after CPR was 56.1%. Survival to discharge was less frequent with a history of congestive heart failure, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, hemodynamic instability during the procedure, and with prolonged or emergent catheterizations. Pulseless electrical activity (versus asystole or ventricular fibrillation) indicated very poor short-term survival. Interestingly, short-term survival was not related to the extent of coronary artery disease. Long-term survival of patients who survived cardiac arrest was comparable to that of those who did not have arrest during catheterization.

We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of 94 patients with SCA due to AMI, who underwent mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation during angiography.

In the age- and sex-adjusted model, patients with serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L had 4.61-times higher odds of survival until discharge from the hospital (95% CI: 1.41−15.05, p = 0.01). Using the highest Youden index, we identified the potassium concentration of 5.1 mmol/L to be the optimal cut-off value for prediction of survival until hospital discharge (83.3% sensitivity and 87.9% specificity). The practical implications of these findings are that patients with potassium levels between 5.0 and 6.0 mmol/L may actually benefit most from percutaneous coronary interventions with ongoing mechanical chest compressions and that they do not need immediate correction for this electrolyte abnormality.",success

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) has shown promising survival rates for in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA), with low-flow time being an independent prognostic factor for CA. However, there is no definitive answer on how to reduce low-flow time. This retrospective study, conducted at a single center, included 39 patients who underwent ECPR during PCI between January 2016 and December 2022. The patients were divided into two cohorts based on whether standby extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was utilized during PCI: standby ECPR (SBE) (<i>n</i> = 13) and extemporaneous ECPR (EE) (<i>n</i> = 26). We compared the 30-day mortality rates between these two cohorts and investigated factors associated with survival. Compared to the EE cohort, the SBE cohort showed significantly lower low-flow time (<i>P</i> < 0.01), ECMO operation time (<i>P</i> < 0.01), and a lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (<i>P</i> = 0.017), as well as peak lactate (<i>P</i> < 0.01).

This document was created using a multimodal methodology for evidence generation and includes information from existing guidelines, from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, from our own structured literature reviews on issues particular to cardiac surgery, and from an international survey on resuscitation hosted by CTSNet. In gathering evidence for this consensus paper, searches were conducted using the MEDLINE keywords ""cardiac surgery,"" ""resuscitation,"" ""guideline,"" ""thoracic surgery,"" ""cardiac arrest,"" and ""cardiac massage."" Weight was given to clinical studies in humans, although some case studies, mannequin simulations of potential protocols, and animal models were also considered. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method consisting of two rounds of voting until 75% agreement on appropriate wording and strength of the opinions was reached. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Workforce on Critical Care was enlisted in this process to provide a wider variety of experiences and backgrounds in an effort to reinforce the opinions provided. We start with the premise that external massage is ineffective for an arrest due to tamponade or hypovolemia (bleeding), and therefore these subsets of patients will receive inadequate cerebral perfusion during cardiac arrest in the absence of resternotomy. Because these two situations are common causes for an arrest after cardiac surgery, the inability to provide effective external cardiopulmonary resuscitation highlights the importance of early emergency resternotomy within 5 minutes. In addition, because internal massage is more effective than external massage, it should be used preferentially if other quickly reversible causes are not found. We present a protocol for the cardiac arrest situation that includes the following recommendations: (1) successful treatment of a patient who arrests after cardiac surgery is a multidisciplinary activity with at least six key roles that should be allocated and rehearsed as a team on a regular basis; (2) patients who arrest with ventricular fibrillation should immediately receive three sequential attempts at defibrillation before external cardiac massage, and if this fails, emergency resternotomy should be performed; (3) patients with asystole or extreme bradycardia should undergo an attempt to pace if wires are available before external cardiac massage, then optionally external pacing followed by emergency resternotomy; and (4) pulseless electrical activity should receive prompt resternotomy after quickly reversible causes are excluded. Finally, we recommend that full doses of epinephrine should not be routinely given owing to the danger of extreme hypertension if a reversible cause is rapidly resolved. Protocols are given for excluding reversible airway and breathing complications, for left ventricular assist device emergencies, for the nonsternotomy patient, and for safe emergency resternotomy. We believe that all cardiac units should have accredited policies and protocols in place to specifically address the resuscitation of patients who arrest after cardiac surgery.",success

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced in patients undergoing electrophysiologic (EP) testing for ventricular arrhythmias or testing of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). A 150-J shock was delivered as the primary therapy to terminate induced arrhythmias in the EP group, and as a ""rescue"" shock when a single ICD shock failed to terminate the arrhythmias in the ICD group.

A crossover was performed between implantation and pre-hospital discharge for biphasic versus monophasic sequence as well as for the 2 different positions. After failed internal shocks, 27 episodes were treated with biphasic, and 23 with monophasic shocks. The first attempt by the external device did not terminate II episodes (2 biphasic, 9 monophasic).

The author, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study comments and weaknesses were tabulated. The quality and level of evidence was assessed using the International Liaison Committee of Resuscitation guideline recommendations. The most recent European Resuscitation Council guidelines suggest single attempts at cardioversion, spaced at 2-min intervals, for all patients going into ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac surgery presents a unique challenge for these guidelines in that emergency re-sternotomy may provide additional lifesaving interventions once it is deemed that external cardioversion is unlikely to succeed. The 15 papers identified demonstrated that the success of the first attempt at cardioversion for VF/VT was around 78%. The chance of the second shock succeeding was around 35%. The chance of a third shock succeeding was 14%. Very little data were found on the chance of further shocks succeeding. Of note none of these papers were in patients on the intensive care after cardiac surgery. We conclude that, due to the importance of minimising the delay to chest reopening, three shocks should be quickly delivered. If these do not succeed the chance of a 4th shock succeeding is likely to be <10% and, thus, immediate chest reopening should be performed.

Circulation was restored after 37 of the 74 thoracotomies (50%), including 8 in Group 2. Nineteen patients (30%) were ultimately discharged; however, no patient in Group 2 survived hospitalization. Of the 19 survivors in Group 1, only 2 of the 13 with a sudden arrhythmia and 3 of the 10 with unexplained hypotension survived. However, 5 of the 6 with tamponade and 9 of the 15 with sudden massive bleeding survived. Overall, 43% of Group 1 patients survived.

Between 1988 and 1999, of 8,807 CABG patients, a total of 76 (0.9%) suffered hemodynamic collapse after CABG surgery unrelated to pericardial tamponade or bleeding. Preoperatively matched patients (by age, sex, New York Heart Association classification, number of diseased vessels, left ventricular ejection fraction, and diabetes) served as a control group (n = 76). Patients with sudden cardiovascular collapse underwent emergency reopening of the sternotomy and open cardiac massage (OCM group). Several pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables were compared, and significant parameters in match-pair analysis were further tested with regression techniques. Of the 76 OCMs, 57 (75%) occurred during the first 5 postoperative hours. In-hospital mortality was 46% (35 of 76) versus 0% in controls; 5-year survival was 49% versus 95%. In the OCM group, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was significantly prolonged (p = 0.0024), and cardiac index (p = 0.05) and the first acid-base values after CPB were lower (pH, p = 0.0057; BE, p = 0.0014). Postoperative myocardial ischemia appeared in 33% of patients in the OCM group and in 8% of controls (p < 0.0001). OCM-group patients more frequently required postoperative inotropic (epinephrine, p = 0.0002) and mechanical support (intra-aortic balloon pump, p = 0.005). Regression analysis revealed a correlation between cardiopulmonary resuscitation risk and low cardiac index, postoperative ischemia, and low pH level. Inadequate tissue perfusion, postoperative myocardial ischemia, and increased need for inotropic and mechanical support preceded hemodynamic collapse. Interventions to improve tissue perfusion and to prevent and treat myocardial ischemia may result in a more favorable outcome.",success

Arrests in theatre and chest openings for reasons other than cardiac arrest. There were 818 confirmed in-hospital arrests following 'cardiac arrest calls'. Chest reopening was undertaken in 79 surgical patients. Overall survival to discharge was 20/79 (25%). Favourable determinants of outcome were: arrest on intensive care unit (ICU), arrest within 24 h of surgery and reopening within 10 min of arrest. Nineteen of 58 (33%) chest openings following arrests on the ICU survived to discharge compared to one of 21 (5%) patients whose initial arrest was outside the ICU (P=0.017). One of nine ward arrests scooped to ICU for chest reopening survived whereas all 12 patients reopened on the ward died. Fifteen of 40 patients (38%) reopened within 24 h surgery survived compared to five of 39 patients where reopening was undertaken more than 24 h after surgery (P=0.02).

This study strongly confirms the benefit of chest reopening after cardiac arrest in the cardiac surgical ICU. Patients who arrest within 24 h of surgery and in whom reopening is instituted within 10 min are particularly likely to benefit. The value of chest reopening in arrests outside the ICU remains unresolved. All patients reopened on the ward died, suggesting that this practice should be discontinued.

Patients presenting to the hospital in cardiac arrest were managed according to the ACLS protocol at the clinician's discretion. Proximal aortic and central venous pressure catheters were placed to measure arteriovenous compression- and relaxation-phase pressure gradients. After 5 mins of baseline measurements during closed-chest cardiac massage, patients underwent a left lateral thoracotomy, and open-chest cardiac massage was performed for 5 mins. The mean coronary perfusion pressure and compression-phase pressure gradients were 7.3 +/- 5.7 and 6.2 +/- 5.4 mm Hg, respectively, during closed-chest cardiac massage, while increasing to 32.6 +/- 17.8 and 32.6 +/- 29.9 mm Hg, respectively, during open-chest cardiac massage.

Patient characteristics in the open-chest CPR group and the standard CPR group were similar. In the open-chest CPR group, 15 patients obtained ROSC. There was a tendency that the ROSC rate was highest in the patients with thoracotomy within 5 min of hospital arrival and declined as the timing of thoracotomy was delayed.

39530213,False,Journal Article;Practice Guideline,,,,,,,,True,"Drowning is the third leading cause of death from unintentional injury worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths. In the United States, drowning is the leading cause of death in children 1 to 4 years of age and second leading cause of death due to unintentional injury in those aged 5 to 14 years. Drowning generally progresses from initial respiratory arrest due to submersion-related hypoxia to cardiac arrest; thus, it can be challenging to distinguish respiratory arrest from cardiac arrest because pulses are difficult to accurately palpate within the recommended 10-second window. Therefore, resuscitation from cardiac arrest due to this specific circumstance must focus on restoring breathing as much as it does circulation. Resuscitation from drowning may begin with in-water rescue breathing when safely provided by rescuers trained in the technique and should continue with chest compressions, in keeping with basic life support guidelines, once the drowned individual and the rescuer are in a safe environment (eg, dry land, boat).

In order to identify predictors for admission and to establish a unified approach for management, we retrospectively collected all children ≤ 16 years old presented following a drowning event to the pediatric ED over a period of 12 years. The children were divided into two groups, those who were discharged home from the ED and those who were admitted. Seventy-one surviving and non-intubated children were asymptomatic to moderately symptomatic, and they comprised the study group.

The data set for analysis comprised all cases of cardiac arrest before the arrival of emergency rescue service personnel that were fully documented in the German Resuscitation Registry in the period 2007-2019.

Altogether, 40 604 cases of cardiac arrest were included. Resuscitation by laypersons was carried out in 35.1% of these cases. The rate of ROSC was statistically significantly higher after lay resuscitation for OHCA caused by cardiac events, drowning, intoxication, or central nervous system disorders (overall 48.1% versus 41.0%). For all causes-with the exception of trauma/bleeding to death and sepsis- the endpoint 30 days' survival/discharged alive was better with lay resuscitation (overall 17.0% versus 9.5%). In multivariate regression analysis, lay resuscitation was associated with improvement of the endpoint 30 days' survival/discharged alive only for OHCA caused by cardiac events (odds ratio [OR] 1.16) or intoxication (OR 1.81).

Receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve (AUC) were generated to test sensitivity and specificity. The derivation data set consisted of 356 patients and validation data set of 89 patients. Five factors generated a safe discharge score at 8 hours: normal ED mentation, normal ED respiratory rate, absence of ED dyspnea, absence of need for airway support (bag-valve mask ventilation, intubation, and CPAP), absence of ED systolic hypotension (maximum score = 5; range = 0-5).

Inclusion criteria for further analysis were nontraumatic background of CA and patients >18 years of age. One hundred and forty-five arterial blood gas analyses including oxygen partial pressure (paO2) measurement were obtained during CPR. We observed a highly significant increase in hospital admission rates associated with increases in paO2 in steps of 100 mmHg (13.3 kPa). Subsequently, data were clustered according to previously described cutoffs (≤ 60 mmHg [8 kPa]], 61-300 mmHg [8.1-40 kPa], >300 mmHg [>40 kPa]). Baseline variables (age, sex, initial rhythm, rate of bystander CPR and collapse-to-CPR time) of the three compared groups did not differ significantly. Rates of hospital admission after CA were 18.8%, 50.6% and 83.3%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, logistic regression revealed significant prognostic value for paO2 and the duration of CPR. This study presents novel human data on the arterial paO2 during CPR in conjunction with the rate of hospital admission. We describe a significantly increased rate of hospital admission associated with increasing paO2. We found that the previously described potentially harmful effects of hyperoxia after return of spontaneous circulation were not reproduced for paO2 measured during CPR. n/a.",success

Multicenter, cluster randomized clinical trial of paramedics from 4 ambulance services in England responding to emergencies for approximately 21 million people. Patients aged 18 years or older who had a nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and were treated by a participating paramedic were enrolled automatically under a waiver of consent between June 2015 and August 2017; follow-up ended in February 2018. Paramedics were randomized 1:1 to use TI (764 paramedics) or SGA (759 paramedics) as their initial advanced airway management strategy.

Patients admitted because of 'drowning' or 'near-drowning' between January 2007 and April 2013 were included. 75 children were included. 63 (84 %) survived without complications, 8 (10.7 %) died and 4 (5.3 %) had permanent neurological sequelae. The median age was 2.2 years (range 0.1-12.4). 46 (60.5 %) incidents happened in or around the home, only 14 (18.7 %) were witnessed. 42 (56 %) took place in a pool (29 private, 13 public). Significant predictors of the outcome were: estimated submersion time, duration of apnea, unresponsive and dilated pupils, intubation and use of inotropes. On arrival at the ER we found these significant predictors of the outcome: CPR, a GCS <5, hypothermia, bradycardia, asystole, as well as the PIM2-calculated mortality risk for patients admitted to the ICU. The majority of incidents were unwitnessed and occurred in or around the home. Prevention programs should be focused on adult supervision for younger children and creating awareness on the dangers of drowning in the home environment. While bathing in baths or buckets, children should never be left alone and parents should be made aware of the dangers. In our study, the majority of incidents occurred in swimming pools and limiting access to these could prevent many incidents of drowning among older children. Although children of all language groups are at risk for drowning, English- or Afrikaans-speaking children were particularly at risk for drowning in private pools while Xhosa-speaking children mostly drowned in baths or buckets. We also report multiple prognostic factors for the outcome, but none of them were absolute predictive of the outcome, indicating that each victim of submersion deserves full resuscitative treatment.",success

This retrospective cohort study used data from the All-Japan Utstein Registry from 2013 to 2021. We included patients aged ≤18 years with drowning-induced cardiac arrest who underwent CPR via emergency medical services. The study's primary outcome was a favorable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2) at 1 month. We also calculated the dynamic proportion of 1-month outcomes as a function of out-of-hospital CPR duration. Moreover, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 33 min of out-of-hospital CPR, which is the time point at which primary analysis showed a plateau in the neurological outcomes. Of 14,849 children included in the registry, 992 cases of drowning-induced cardiac arrest were analyzed. The median out-of-hospital CPR duration was 20 (range, 2-164) min, with only 35 (3.5 %) patients showing favorable neurological outcomes at 1 month. The proportion of favorable neurological outcomes decreased rapidly for up to 33 min of out-of-hospital CPR and then plateaued to 0.3 %; only three patients achieved favorable neurological outcomes after 33 min of CPR. An out-of-hospital CPR duration of >33 min was associated with poor neurological outcomes (sensitivity, 0.17 [95 % confidence interval: 0.15-0.20]; specificity, 0.91 [0.77-0.98]; and positive predictive value, 0.98 [0.95-1.00]).

Each participant's CPR skills were evaluated at the end of training and 3 months thereafter using the Resusci Anne manikin with a skill-reporting software. In total, 252 participants completed training; there were 125 in the hands-only CPR group and 127 in the conventional CPR group. After 3 months, 118 participants were randomly selected to complete a post-training test. The hands-only CPR group showed a significant decrease in average compression rate (P=0.015), average compression depth (P=0.031), and proportion of adequate compression depth (P=0.011).

Those in the staged group were first taught chest compression alone; chest compression with ventilation in a ratio of 50:5 was introduced at the second class; full standard CPR was taught at the third class. A total of 495 volunteers entered the study, 262 being randomly allocated to conventional training, and 233 to staged training. More of those who received staged training attended a second (78 volunteers) and third class (41 volunteers), compared with those who received conventional training (36 and 17, respectively). The objective of this study, however, was to compare the strategies of the different training methods. A total of 291 volunteers (167 conventional and 124 staged training) were available for unannounced home testing of full conventional CPR 6 months after initial training, and 260 volunteers (135 conventional and 125 staged training) were tested at 12 months. At 6 months, those taught by the staged method were significantly better at time to first compression (P < 0.0001), compression rate (P = 0.024), and hand position (P = 0.0001). At 12 months, those taught by the staged method were significantly better at shouting for help (P = 0.005), time to first compression (P < 0.0001), and compression depth (P = 0.003).

Of the 504 561 OHCA cases recorded in the nationwide database between 2016 and 2019, 16 376 (3.2%) were presumably caused by drowning. The main outcomes were a 1-month neurological prognosis defined as cerebral performance category 1 or 2 and 1-month survival as measures. The incidence of drowning as a presumed cause of OHCA was high in the winter and the middle-aged and older generations in Japan. However, OHCA caused by drowning in the younger generation frequently occurs in the summer. Furthermore, younger patients had higher incidences of bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest (22.0%), BCPR provision (59.3%) and arrest in outdoor settings (54.0%) than middle-aged and older generations (5.9%, 46.1% and 18.7% respectively). If the patient was younger or the arrest was accidental, the conventional BCPR group had better neurological outcomes than the compression-only BCPR group (95% CI of adjusted OR, 1.22 to 12.2 and 1.80 to 5.57, respectively). However, in the case of middle-aged and older generations and medical categories, there was no significant difference in outcomes between the two types of BCPR. This conventional group's advantage was maintained even after matching.

Six AEDs were tested for their reliability, robustness and stability. Data were collected on three different types of RIBs, in a harbour and at sea. Each AED was connected to a volunteer and a manikin simulating VF. Data from the AED were continuously collected. At one of the RIBs each AED became wet; no AED had a technical problem. When connected to the volunteer, the ECGs delivered by the AEDs showed a regular sinus rhythm. When connected to a manikin in VF, each AED was able to recognise VF and to provide a shock. There were differences in the time between first analysis and the shock. The voice prompt of the Zoll AED Plus was 'understandable', while the other AEDs were 'difficult to understand'. We had a problem with the infrared connection, which means that evaluation and quality control afterwards may be difficult. The use of AEDs on RIBs during patient transport over calm water is possible and effective. The AED should have a screen and better features to download data. However, AEDs are only worthwhile when they fit well in the Chain of Survival (fast arrival, immediately availability of an AED, trained provider and advanced life support).",success

One of the barriers towards increased use might be cost-effectiveness. We compared the cost-effectiveness of public AEDs to no AEDs for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States over a life-time horizon. The analysis assumed a societal perspective and results are presented as costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Model inputs were based on reviews of the literature. For the base case, we modelled an annual cardiac arrest incidence per AED of 20%. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for joint parameter uncertainty. The no AED strategy resulted in 1.63 QALYs at a cost of $28,964. The AED strategy yielded an additional 0.26 QALYs for an incremental increase in cost of $13,793 per individual. The AED strategy yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $53,797 per QALY gained. The yearly incidence of cardiac arrests occurring in the presence of an AED had minimal effect on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio except at very low incidences. In several sensitivity analyses across a plausible range of health care and societal estimates, the AED strategy remained cost-effective. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the AED strategy was cost-effective in 43%, 85%, and 91% of the scenarios at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY gained, respectively.

The primary outcome was survival at 1 month after cardiac arrest with favourable neurological outcomes (cerebral performance category 1-2). Among 280 eligible patients who had bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest and received defibrillation at railroad stations, 245 patients (87.5%) received defibrillation using public-access AEDs and 35 patients (12.5%) received defibrillation administered by emergency medical services (EMS).

However, at the present time it is still unclear to identify public places with a high incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. There are few data on the potential impact of public access defibrillators on survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in sporting arenas or water parks. Therefore, we studied prospectively incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the LAGO-die Therme in Herne. This is one of the most important swimming parks in Europe and member of the European Waterpark Association EWA. Eight AEDs were placed in the waterpark LAGO-die Therme. The locations where the defibrillators were stored were chosen to make possible a target interval of 60 seconds from collapse to first defibrillation. Twenty waterpark officers were instructed in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in the use of the AED. During November 16, 2001 and December 31, 2004, 2.05 Mio. visitors were counted in the LAGO. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest occurred in none of them. AED were used in two visitors with non arrhythmogenic syncope, no shock was delivered. Questionaires were done in 588 visitors (336 males, 252 females, mean age 38+21 years) in 2002 and in 579 visitors (322 males, 257 females, mean age 37+/-25 years) in 2004. In 2002, 77% of the visitors noticed the AED and, therefore, 49% performed more sporting activities. In addition, in 2004, AED was noticed by 480 visitors (83%) and 277 visitors (48%) did more sporting activities. There were no significant differences between 2002 and 2004 (p=ns).

Our retrospective observational study was designed to determine the prevalence of ECG abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias after EA, to evaluate the predictive value of cardiac biomarkers for this condition and to assess in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Consecutive patients presenting after EA at the emergency department of our institution between 2011 and 2016 were involved in the current analysis. ECG abnormalities and arrhythmias were analyzed at admission and during ECG monitoring. Levels of cardiac troponin I, CK and CK-MB were also collected. In-hospital and 30-day mortality data were obtained from hospital records and from the national insurance database. Of the 480 patients included, 184 (38.3%) had suffered a workplace accident. The majority of patients (96.2%) had incurred a low-voltage injury (< 1000 V). One hundred and four (21.7%) patients had a transthoracic electrical injury while 13 (2.7%) patients reported loss of consciousness. The most frequent ECG disorders at admission were sinus bradycardia (< 60 bpm, n = 50, 10.4%) and sinus tachycardia (> 100 bpm, n = 21, 4.4%). Other detected arrhythmias were as follows: newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (n = 1); frequent multifocal atrial premature complexes (n = 1); sinus arrest with atrial escape rhythm (n = 2); ventricular fibrillation terminated out of hospital (n = 1); ventricular bigeminy (n = 1); and repetitive nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 1).

To study the mechanism of the BIPA in DCS, we examined the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), heparin (Hep), and clopidogrel (Clo), with anti-thrombotic dose pretreatment in a rat model of DCS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 208) were randomly assigned to one experimental group treated before the hyperbaric exposure and decompression protocol either with ASA (3×100 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1), n = 30), Clo (50 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1), n = 60), Hep (500 IU/kg, n = 30), or to untreated group (n = 49). Rats were first compressed to 1,000 kPa (90 msw) for 45 min and then decompressed to surface in 38 min.

Onset of DCS symptoms and death were recorded during a 60-min observation period after surfacing. DCS evaluation included pulmonary and neurological signs. Blood samples for platelet count (PC) were taken 30 min before hyperbaric exposure and 30 min after surfacing. Clo reduces the DCS mortality risk (mortality rate: 3/60 with Clo, 15/30 with ASA, 21/30 with Hep, and 35/49 in the untreated group) and DCS severity (neurological DCS incidence: 9/60 with Clo, 6/30 with ASA, 5/30 with Hep, and 12/49 in the untreated group). Clo reduced fall in platelet count and BIPA (-4,5% with Clo, -19.5% with ASA, -19,9% with Hep, and -29,6% in the untreated group). ASA, which inhibits the thromboxane A2 pathway, and Hep, which inhibits thrombin generation, have no protective effect on DCS incidence.

These emboli can arise in many clinical settings such as neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, and liver transplantation, but more recently, endoscopy, hemodialysis, thoracentesis, tissue biopsy, angiography, and central and peripheral venous access and removal have overtaken surgery and trauma as significant causes of vascular air embolism. The true incidence may be greater since many of these air emboli are asymptomatic and frequently go undiagnosed or unreported. Due to the rarity of vascular air embolism and because of the many manifestations, diagnoses can be difficult and require immediate therapeutic intervention. An iatrogenic air embolism can result in both venous and arterial emboli whose anatomic locations dictate the clinical course. Most clinically significant iatrogenic air emboli are caused by arterial obstruction of small vessels because the pulmonary gas exchange filters the more frequent, smaller volume bubbles that gain access to the venous circulation. However, there is a subset of patients with venous air emboli caused by larger volumes of air who present with more protean manifestations. There have been significant gains in the understanding of the interactions of fluid dynamics, hemostasis, and inflammation caused by air emboli due to <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies on flow dynamics of bubbles in small vessels. Intensive research regarding the thromboinflammatory changes at the level of the endothelium has been described recently.

Peak right ventricular (RV) diameter increase and mean arterial pressure decrease were greater in the repositioned animals compared with those in the supine position (P < 0.05). Right ventricular diameter and mean arterial pressure showed an inverse correlation (r = 0.81). Peak left atrial diameter decrease was greater in the LLR and LLR-10 degrees positions compared with the supine position (P < 0.05). Repositioning did not influence peak pulmonary artery pressure increase, and no correlation was found between RV diameter and pulmonary artery pressure. All animals showed electrocardiogram and echocardiographic changes reconcilable with myocardial ischemia. In dogs, body repositioning after VAE provided no benefit in hemodynamic performance or cardiac dimension changes, although relocation of intracardiac air was demonstrated. Right ventricular air did not appear to result in significant RV outflow obstruction, as pulmonary artery pressure increased uniformly in all groups and was not influenced by the relocation of intracardiac air.

Our observations are supportive of a multitiered testing approach, including the use of serological diagnostics, in order to accomplish exhaustive case detection along the whole COVID-19 spectrum. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> We describe the results of testing frontline health care workers, from a hospital in Japan that had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Antibody testing revealed that a surprising 42% of overlooked COVID-19 diagnoses occurred when case detection relied solely on PCR-based viral detection. COVID-19 clusters have been continuously striking the health care system around the globe. Our findings illustrate that such clusters are lined with hidden infections eluding detection with diagnostic PCR and that the cluster burden in total is more immense than actually recognized. The mainstays of diagnosing infectious diseases, including COVID-19, generally consist of two approaches, one aiming to detect molecular fragments of the invading pathogen and the other to measure immune responses of the host. Considering antibody testing as one trustworthy option to test our way through the pandemic can aid in the exhaustive case detection of COVID-19 patients with variable presentations.",success
37921438,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"It is unclear if cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an aerosol-generating procedure and whether this poses a risk of airborne disease transmission to healthcare workers and bystanders. Use of airborne transmission precautions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation may confer rescuer protection but risks patient harm due to delays in commencing treatment. To quantify the risk of respiratory aerosol generation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in humans, we conducted an aerosol monitoring study during out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Exhaled aerosol was recorded using an optical particle sizer spectrometer connected to the breathing system. Aerosol produced during resuscitation was compared with that produced by control participants under general anaesthesia ventilated with an equivalent respiratory pattern to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A porcine cardiac arrest model was used to determine the independent contributions of ventilatory breaths, chest compressions and external cardiac defibrillation to aerosol generation. Time-series analysis of participants with cardiac arrest (n = 18) demonstrated a repeating waveform of respiratory aerosol that mapped to specific components of resuscitation. Very high peak aerosol concentrations were generated during ventilation of participants with cardiac arrest with median (IQR [range]) 17,926 (5546-59,209 [1523-242,648]) particles.l<sup>-1</sup> , which were 24-fold greater than in control participants under general anaesthesia (744 (309-2106 [23-9099]) particles.l<sup>-1</sup> , p < 0.001, n = 16). A substantial rise in aerosol also occurred with cardiac defibrillation and chest compressions. In a complimentary porcine model of cardiac arrest, aerosol recordings showed a strikingly similar profile to the human data. Time-averaged aerosol concentrations during ventilation were approximately 270-fold higher than before cardiac arrest (19,410 (2307-41,017 [104-136,025]) vs. 72 (41-136 [23-268]) particles.l<sup>-1</sup> , p = 0.008). The porcine model also confirmed that both defibrillation and chest compressions generate high concentrations of aerosol independent of, but synergistic with, ventilation. In conclusion, multiple components of cardiopulmonary resuscitation generate high concentrations of respiratory aerosol. We recommend that airborne transmission precautions are warranted in the setting of high-risk pathogens, until the airway is secured with an airway device and breathing system with a filter.",success
36336542,True,Multicenter Study;Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"To describe endotracheal intubation practices in emergency departments by staff intubating patients early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Multicenter prospective cohort study of endotracheal intubations conducted at 20 US academic emergency departments from May to December 2020, stratified by known or suspected COVID-19 status. We used multivariable regression to measure the association between intubation strategy, COVID-19 known or suspected status, first-pass success, and adverse events. There were 3,435 unique emergency department endotracheal intubations by 586 participating physicians or advanced practice providers; 565 (18%) patients were known or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of endotracheal intubation. Compared with patients not known or suspected of COVID-19, endotracheal intubations of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 were more often performed using video laryngoscopy (88% versus 82%, difference 6.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0% to 9.6%) and passive nasal oxygenation (44% versus 39%, difference 5.1%; 95% CI, 0.9% to 9.3%). First-pass success was not different between those who were and were not known or suspected of COVID-19 (87% versus 86%, difference 0.6%; 95% CI, -2.4% to 3.6%). Adjusting for patient characteristics and procedure factors in those with low anticipated airway difficulty (n=2,374), adverse events (most commonly hypoxia) occurred more frequently in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 (35% versus 19%, adjusted odds ratio 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 3.3). Compared with patients not known or suspected of COVID-19, endotracheal intubation of those confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 was associated with a similar first-pass intubation success rate but higher risk-adjusted adverse events.",success

The objective of this study was to determine the attributable risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from providing ED care, describe personal protective equipment use, and identify modifiable ED risk factors. We hypothesized that providing ED patient care increases the probability of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study of 1,673 ED physicians, advanced practice providers (APPs), nurses, and nonclinical staff at 20 U.S. centers over 20 weeks (May to December 2020; before vaccine availability) to detect a four-percentage point increased SARS-CoV-2 incidence among HCP related to direct patient care. Participants provided monthly nasal and serology specimens and weekly exposure and procedure information. We used multivariable regression and recursive partitioning to identify risk factors. Over 29,825 person-weeks, 75 participants (4.5%) acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection (31 were asymptomatic). Physicians/APPs (aOR 1.07; 95% CI 0.56-2.03) did not have higher risk of becoming infected compared to nonclinical staff, but nurses had a marginally increased risk (aOR 1.91; 95% CI 0.99-3.68). Over 99% of participants used CDC-recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), but PPE lapses occurred in 22.1% of person-weeks and 32.1% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patient intubations. The following factors were associated with infection: household SARS-CoV-2 exposure; hospital and community SARS-CoV-2 burden; community exposure; and mask non-use in public. SARS-CoV-2 intubation was not associated with infection (attributable risk fraction 13.8%; 95% CI -2.0-38.2%), and nor were PPE lapses. Among unvaccinated U.S. ED HCP during the height of the pandemic, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar in nonclinical staff and HCP engaged in direct patient care. Many identified risk factors were related to community exposures.",success
34263582,False,Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of European Resuscitation Council (ERC) COVID-19-guidelines on resuscitation quality emphasizing advanced airway management in out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest. In a manikin study paramedics and emergency physicians performed advanced cardiac life support in three settings: ERC guidelines 2015 (control), COVID-19-guidelines as suggested with minimum staff (COVID-19-minimal-personnel); COVID-19-guidelines with paramedics and an emergency physician (COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager). Main outcome measures were no-flow-time, quality metrics as defined by ERC and time intervals to first chest compression, oxygen supply, intubation and first rhythm analysis. Data were presented as mean±standard deviation. Thirty resuscitation scenarios were completed. No-flow-time was markedly prolonged in COVID-19-minimal-personnel (113±37 s) compared to control (55±9 s) and COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager (76±38s; P<0.001 each). In both COVID-19-groups chest compressions started later (COVID-19-minimal-personnel: 32±6 s; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager: 37±7 s; each P<0.001 vs. control [21±5 s]), but oxygen supply (COVID-19-minimal-personnel: 29±5 s; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager: 34±7 s; each P<0.001 vs. control [77±19 s]) and first intubation attempt (COVID-19-minimal-personnel: 111±14 s; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager: 131±20 s; each P<0.001 vs. control [178±44 s]) were performed earlier. However, time interval to successful intubation was similar (control: 198±48 s; COVID-19-minimal-personnel: 181±42 s; COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager: 130±25 s) due to a longer intubation time in COVID-19-minimal-personnel (61±35 s) compared to COVID-19-advanced-airway-manager (P=0.002) and control (19±6 s; P<0.001). Time to first rhythm analysis was more than doubled in COVID-19-minimal-personnel (138±96 s) compared to control (50±12 s; P<0.001). Delayed chest compressions and prolonged no-flow-time markedly reduced the quality of resuscitation. These negative effects were attenuated by increasing the number of staff and by adding an experienced airway manager. The use of endotracheal intubation for reducing aerosol release during resuscitation should be discussed critically as its priorization is associated with an increase in no-flow-time.",success

Data on guideline compliance on how to dress (donning) or remove (doffing) PPE and the assistance among multiple participants (buddying) are limited. This study assesses the quality of donning, doffing, and buddying of PPE in a simulated medical emergency. Physicians handling a simulated cardiac arrest of a COVID-19 patient. Adjacent to the victim, PPE was available. The appropriateness of PPE choice was assessed by using video recordings, with each individual participant being analyzed from the beginning of the simulation scenario from two perspectives regarding the selection of items during donning and doffing, hygiene aspects, time, and team support (buddying). The primary outcome was the number of participants being appropriately protected, defined as both wearing (a) all PPE items provided, and (b) all PPE items correctly at the time of first patient contact (FPC). Secondary outcomes included the timing of participants being appropriately protected. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 28). Mann-Whitney test, chi-square test, and linear regression analysis were performed as appropriate. At first patient contact 21% (91/437) were correctly protected. One or more incorrect PPE items were found in 4% (19/437), whereas 61% (265/437) wore one or more PPE items incorrectly. In 14% (62/437), one or more PPE items were missing. The time interval between donning start and FPC was 66 (55-78) sec. Time to FPC was longer in correctly than in incorrectly protected participants 77 (66-87) vs. 64 (54-75) sec; p < 0.001) and decreased by 7 ± 2 s per PPE item omitted (P = 0.002). Correct doffing was observed in 192/345 (56%), while buddying occurred in 120 participants (27%), indicating that they either assisted other participants in some manner (verbally or physically) or received assistance themselves. Our findings imply a need for education in correct and timely PPE donning and doffing. Donning PPE as intended delayed FPC. This and the influence of buddying needs further investigation (German study register number DRKS00023184).",success
18652725,True,Journal Article;Randomized Controlled Trial,,,,,,,,True,"We sought to determine whether the use of currently issued gowns delays initiation of chest compressions and ventilations during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and whether simple gown modifications can reduce this delay. Firefighter defibrillation instructors were allocated into pairs and videotaped while performing standardized cardiac arrest scenarios. Three scenarios were compared: ""no gown,"" ""standard gown"" and ""modified gown."" Key time intervals were extracted from videotaped data. Ninety-five scenarios were analyzed. Mean time interval to chest compression was 39 seconds (95% confidence interval [CI] 34-43) for ""no gown"" scenarios, 71 seconds (95% CI 66-77) for ""standard gown"" scenarios and 59 seconds (95% CI 54-63) for ""modified gown"" scenarios (p < 0.001). Time to first ventilation was 146 seconds (95% CI 134-158), 238 seconds (95% CI 224-253) and 210 seconds (95% CI 198-223) in the 3 groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Post hoc testing showed that the time differences between all groups were statistically significant. Standard gowns protect front-line care providers but cause significant delays to chest compressions and ventilations, potentially increasing patient morbidity and mortality. Minor gown modifications, including pre-tied neck straps and longer waist ties that tie in front, allow for easier use and shorter delays to time-critical interventions. Future research is required to reduce care delays while maintaining adequate protection of emergency medical service providers from infectious disease.",success
33500008,False,Comparative Study;Journal Article,,,,,,,,True,"On-boat resuscitation can be applied by lifeguards in an inflatable rescue boat (IRB). Due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) and recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), prehospital care procedures need to be re-evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine how the use of PPE influences the amount of preparation time needed before beginning actual resuscitation and the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; QCPR) on an IRB. Three CPR tests were performed by 14 lifeguards, in teams of two, wearing different PPE: (1) Basic PPE (B-PPE): gloves, a mask, and protective glasses; (2) Full PPE (F-PPE): B-PPE + a waterproof apron; and (3) Basic PPE + plastic blanket (B+PPE). On-boat resuscitation using a bag-valve-mask (BVM) and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was performed sailing at 20km/hour. Using B-PPE takes less time and is significantly faster than F-PPE (B-PPE 17 [SD = 2] seconds versus F-PPE 69 [SD = 17] seconds; P = .001), and the use of B+PPE is slightly higher (B-PPE 17 [SD = 2] seconds versus B+PPE 34 [SD = 6] seconds; P = .002). The QCPR remained similar in all three scenarios (P >.05), reaching values over 79%. The use of PPE during on-board resuscitation is feasible and does not interfere with quality when performed by trained lifeguards. The use of a plastic blanket could be a quick and easy alternative to offer extra protection to lifeguards during CPR on an IRB.",success

Twenty-four eligible participants were recruited. Participants' age, sex, height, and weight were recorded. After completing the CPR training and examination, participants were tested twice, wearing surgical mask or an N95 mask, while performing chest compressions for 2 minutes. The quality of chest compression (including compression frequency, depth, rebound, and position) was recorded by the simulator. Borg fatigue scores and physiological parameters (including heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulse oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate) were recorded before and after chest compressions. Compared to wearing surgical masks, participants wearing N95 masks had significantly lower quality of chest compression, including compression frequency (98.3 ± 4.9 bpm vs 104.0 ± 6.0 bpm, P < 0.001), depth (47.1 ± 4.5 mm vs 50.5 ± 5.4 mm, P < 0.001), and rebound (90.2 ± 2.7% vs 94.3 ± 2.1%, P < 0.001). The compression position was not affected. The period data showed that the difference in compression quality started after 1 minute of compressions. Participants wearing N95 masks had higher Borg fatigue scores [6.1(2) vs 5.1(2), P < 0.001], heart rates (121.2 ± 5.7 bpm vs 109.9 ± 6.0 bpm, P < 0.001), mean arterial pressures (106.3 ± 8.0 mmHg vs 99.0 ± 8.5 mmHg, P = 0.012), and respiratory rates (29.5 ± 2.7 bpm vs 24.7 ± 2.5 bpm, P < 0.001).
