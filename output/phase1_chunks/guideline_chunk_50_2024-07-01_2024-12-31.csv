Members of the writing group were chosen to represent the multidisciplinary team of professionals who care for people who have had a stroke. Each member was assigned a topic within their area of expertise, reviewed the literature, and drafted content with a focus on the past decade to complement the 2014 American Heart Association scientific statement on palliative and end-of-life care in stroke. Stroke has multidimensional effects on patients and their families because of threats to personhood, prognostic uncertainty, and the need to adapt to functional changes after stroke. Palliative care has evolved as both a specialty and a skillset with a goal to improve communication about goals of care and quality of life for patients and their families that emphasizes a holistic, all-person approach. After stroke, palliative care needs (eg, to address pain and physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual distress) are insufficiently addressed by current models of care. Integrating palliative care principles is fundamental in all stages of stroke and should include strategies to improve communication about prognosis and goals of care, address psychosocial needs such as coping with loss, navigating complex health care systems, and preparing for death when necessary. We also review strategies to address the substantial inequities that exist across sociodemographic and regional strata in the use of life-sustaining treatment and access to specialists in stroke or palliative care. Palliative care needs are common after stroke and should be addressed throughout the illness continuum. Research is urgently needed.",2025,Feb 2025,,39676661,,10.1161/STR.0000000000000479,Stroke,Palliative and End-of-Life Care in Stroke: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e75,e86,56,2,Humans; Stroke; American Heart Association; Terminal Care; Palliative Care; United States; Quality of Life,Stroke; American Heart Association; Terminal Care; Palliative Care,"Humans; Stroke/therapy, psychology; American Heart Association; Terminal Care/standards, methods; Palliative Care/standards, methods; United States; Quality of Life",AHA Scientific Statements; palliative care; stroke; terminal care,"Journal Article, Review"

This updated guideline is intended to be a resource for clinicians to use to guide various prevention strategies for individuals with no history of stroke. A comprehensive search for literature published since the 2014 guideline; derived from research involving human participants published in English; and indexed in MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and other selected and relevant databases was conducted between May and November 2023. Other documents on related subject matter previously published by the American Heart Association were also reviewed. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes lead to significant disability but, most important, are preventable. The 2024 primary prevention of stroke guideline provides recommendations based on current evidence for strategies to prevent stroke throughout the life span. These recommendations align with the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 for optimizing cardiovascular and brain health, in addition to preventing incident stroke. We also have added sex-specific recommendations for screening and prevention of stroke, which are new compared with the 2014 guideline. Many recommendations for similar risk factor prevention were updated, new topics were reviewed, and recommendations were created when supported by sufficient-quality published data.",2024,Dec 2024,,39429201,,10.1161/STR.0000000000000475,Stroke,2024 Guideline for the Primary Prevention of Stroke: A Guideline From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.,e344,e424,55,12,Humans; American Heart Association; Stroke; Primary Prevention; United States; Risk Factors,American Heart Association; Stroke; Primary Prevention,"Humans; American Heart Association; Stroke/prevention & control; Primary Prevention/methods, standards; United States; Risk Factors",AHA Scientific Statements; guideline; hemorrhagic stroke; ischemic stroke; stroke,"Journal Article, Practice Guideline, Review"

In addition, the advent of new care models, including virtual and remote delivery of cardiac rehabilitation services, has expanded the ways that cardiac rehabilitation programs can reach patients. In this scientific statement, we update the scientific basis of the core components of patient assessment, nutritional counseling, weight management and body composition, cardiovascular disease and risk factor management, psychosocial management, aerobic exercise training, strength training, and physical activity counseling. In addition, in recognition that high-quality cardiac rehabilitation programs regularly monitor their processes and outcomes and engage in an ongoing process of quality improvement, we introduce a new core component of program quality. High-quality program performance will be essential to improve widely documented low enrollment and adherence rates and reduce health disparities in cardiac rehabilitation access.",2024,Oct 2024,10/29/2024,39315436,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001289,Circulation,Core Components of Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs: 2024 Update: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association and the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation.,e328,e347,150,18,Humans; Cardiac Rehabilitation; United States; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases; Secondary Prevention,Cardiac Rehabilitation; American Heart Association,"Humans; Cardiac Rehabilitation/standards, methods; United States; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control; Secondary Prevention/standards, methods",AHA Scientific Statements; cardiac rehabilitation; cardiovascular diseases; secondary prevention,"Journal Article, Review, Practice Guideline"

Despite the widespread availability of both pharmacological and lifestyle therapeutic options, blood pressure control rates across the globe are worsening. In fact, only 23% of individuals with high blood pressure in the United States achieve treatment goals. In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved renal denervation, a catheter-based procedure that ablates the renal sympathetic nerves, as an adjunctive treatment for patients in whom lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications do not adequately control blood pressure. This approval followed the publication of multiple randomized clinical studies using rigorous trial designs, all incorporating renal angiogram as the sham control. Most but not all of the new generation of trials reached their primary end point, demonstrating modest efficacy of renal denervation in lowering blood pressure across a spectrum of hypertension, from mild to truly resistant. Individual patient responses vary, and further research is needed to identify those who may benefit most. The initial safety profile appears favorable, and multiple ongoing studies are assessing longer-term efficacy and safety. Multidisciplinary teams that include hypertension specialists and adequately trained proceduralists are crucial to ensure that referrals are made appropriately with full consideration of the potential risks and benefits. Incorporating patient preferences and engaging in shared decision-making conversations will help patients make the best decisions given their individual circumstances. Although further research is clearly needed, renal denervation presents a novel treatment strategy for patients with uncontrolled blood pressure.",2024,Oct 2024,,39101202,,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000240,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",Renal Denervation for the Treatment of Hypertension: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e135,e148,81,10,Humans; Hypertension; United States; Sympathectomy; American Heart Association; Kidney; Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure; Catheter Ablation; Treatment Outcome,Hypertension; Sympathectomy; American Heart Association; Kidney,"Humans; Hypertension/surgery, physiopathology; United States; Sympathectomy/methods; American Heart Association; Kidney/innervation; Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use; Blood Pressure/physiology; Catheter Ablation/methods; Treatment Outcome",AHA Scientific Statements; blood pressure; catheters; denervation; hypertension; kidney; patient care team,"Journal Article, Review"
"Bress AP, Anderson TS, Flack JM, Ghazi L, Hall ME, Laffer CL, Still CH, Taler SJ, Zachrison KS, Chang TI, American Heart Association Council on Hypertension; Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; and Council on Clinical Cardiology",,,,[''],"Over the past 3 decades, a substantial body of high-quality evidence has guided the diagnosis and management of elevated blood pressure (BP) in the outpatient setting. In contrast, there is a lack of comparable evidence for guiding the management of elevated BP in the acute care setting, resulting in significant practice variation. Throughout this scientific statement, we use the terms acute care and inpatient to refer to care received in the emergency department and after admission to the hospital. Elevated inpatient BP is common and can manifest either as asymptomatic or with signs of new or worsening target-organ damage, a condition referred to as hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency involves acute target-organ damage and should be treated swiftly, usually with intravenous antihypertensive medications, in a closely monitored setting. However, the risk-benefit ratio of initiating or intensifying antihypertensive medications for asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP is less clear. Despite this ambiguity, clinicians prescribe oral or intravenous antihypertensive medications in approximately one-third of cases of asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP. Recent observational studies have suggested potential harms associated with treating asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP, which brings current practice into question. Despite the ubiquity of elevated inpatient BPs, few position papers, guidelines, or consensus statements have focused on improving BP management in the acute care setting. Therefore, this scientific statement aims to synthesize the available evidence, provide suggestions for best practice based on the available evidence, identify evidence-based gaps in managing elevated inpatient BP (asymptomatic and hypertensive emergency), and highlight areas requiring further research.",2024,Aug 2024,,38804130,,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000238,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",The Management of Elevated Blood Pressure in the Acute Care Setting: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e94,e106,81,8,Humans; Hypertension; Antihypertensive Agents; American Heart Association; United States; Blood Pressure; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Blood Pressure Determination,Hypertension; Antihypertensive Agents; American Heart Association,"Humans; Hypertension/diagnosis, drug therapy, physiopathology, therapy; Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use; American Heart Association; United States; Blood Pressure/physiology, drug effects; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Blood Pressure Determination/methods, standards",AHA Scientific Statements; antihypertensive agents; blood pressure; hospitalization; hypertension; inpatients,"Journal Article, Review"
