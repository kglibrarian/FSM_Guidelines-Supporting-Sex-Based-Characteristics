Both age-related physiological changes and accumulated cardiovascular risk factors increase the susceptibility to acute coronary syndrome over a lifetime. Compared with younger patients, outcomes for acute coronary syndrome in the large and growing demographic of older adults are relatively worse. Increased atherosclerotic plaque burden and complexity of anatomic disease, compounded by age-related cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbid conditions, contribute to the worse prognosis observed in older individuals. Geriatric syndromes, including frailty, multimorbidity, impaired cognitive and physical function, polypharmacy, and other complexities of care, can undermine the therapeutic efficacy of guidelines-based treatments and the resiliency of older adults to survive and recover, as well. In this American Heart Association scientific statement, we (1) review age-related physiological changes that predispose to acute coronary syndrome and management complexity; (2) describe the influence of commonly encountered geriatric syndromes on cardiovascular disease outcomes; and (3) recommend age-appropriate and guideline-concordant revascularization and acute coronary syndrome management strategies, including transitions of care, the use of cardiac rehabilitation, palliative care services, and holistic approaches. The primacy of individualized risk assessment and patient-centered care decision-making is highlighted throughout.",2023,Jan 2023,01/17/2023,36503287,PMC10312228,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001112,Circulation,Management of Acute Coronary Syndrome in the Older Adult Population: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e32,e62,147,3,United States; Humans; Aged; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Risk Factors; American Heart Association; Risk Assessment; Prognosis,Acute Coronary Syndrome,"United States/epidemiology; Humans; Aged; Acute Coronary Syndrome/diagnosis, epidemiology, therapy; Risk Factors; American Heart Association; Risk Assessment; Prognosis",AHA Scientific Statements; acute coronary syndrome; cardiovascular diseases; frailty; geriatric assessment; multimorbidity; polypharmacy,"Journal Article, Review"

The goal of this updated 2022 CAD-RADS 2.0 is to improve the initial reporting system for CCTA by considering new technical developments in Cardiac CT, including data from recent clinical trials and new clinical guidelines. The updated CAD-RADS classification will follow an established framework of stenosis, plaque burden, and modifiers, which will include assessment of lesion-specific ischemia using CT fractional-flow-reserve (CT-FFR) or myocardial CT perfusion (CTP), when performed. Similar to the method used in the original CAD-RADS version, the determinant for stenosis severity classification will be the most severe coronary artery luminal stenosis on a per-patient basis, ranging from CAD-RADS 0 (zero) for absence of any plaque or stenosis to CAD-RADS 5 indicating the presence of at least one totally occluded coronary artery. Given the increasing data supporting the prognostic relevance of coronary plaque burden, this document will provide various methods to estimate and report total plaque burden. The addition of P1 to P4 descriptors are used to denote increasing categories of plaque burden. The main goal of CAD-RADS, which should always be interpreted together with the impression found in the report, remains to facilitate communication of test results with referring physicians along with suggestions for subsequent patient management. In addition, CAD-RADS will continue to provide a framework of standardization that may benefit education, research, peer-review, artificial intelligence development, clinical trial design, population health and quality assurance with the ultimate goal of improving patient care.",2022,Nov 2022,,36436841,,10.1016/j.jacr.2022.09.012,Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,"CAD-RADS™ 2.0 - 2022 Coronary Artery Disease - Reporting and Data System.: An expert consensus document of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the North America Society of Cardiovascular Imaging (NASCI).",1185,1212,19,11,"Humans; United States; Coronary Artery Disease; Consensus; Constriction, Pathologic; Artificial Intelligence; Predictive Value of Tests; Computed Tomography Angiography; Coronary Stenosis; Cardiology; North America; Radiology",Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Stenosis; Cardiology; Radiology,"Humans; United States; Coronary Artery Disease/diagnostic imaging; Consensus; Constriction, Pathologic; Artificial Intelligence; Predictive Value of Tests; Computed Tomography Angiography; Coronary Stenosis; Cardiology; North America; Radiology",CAD-RADS; Coronary CTA; Coronary artery disease; Ischemia; Plaque burden; Report standardization terminology; Reporting and data system; Stenosis severity,"Practice Guideline, Journal Article"

In this scientific statement, we review evidence from the past decade related to coronary heart disease screening and management for kidney and liver transplantation candidates. Coronary heart disease screening in asymptomatic kidney and liver transplantation candidates has not been demonstrated to improve outcomes but is common in practice. Risk stratification algorithms based on the presence or absence of clinical risk factors and physical performance have been proposed, but a high proportion of candidates still meet criteria for screening tests. We suggest new approaches to pretransplantation evaluation grounded on the presence or absence of known coronary heart disease and cardiac symptoms and emphasize multidisciplinary engagement, including involvement of a dedicated cardiologist. Noninvasive functional screening methods such as stress echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy have limited accuracy, and newer noninvasive modalities, especially cardiac computed tomography-based tests, are promising alternatives. Emerging evidence such as results of the 2020 International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease trial emphasizes the vital importance of guideline-directed medical therapy in managing diagnosed coronary heart disease and further questions the value of revascularization among asymptomatic kidney transplantation candidates. Optimizing strategies to disseminate and implement best practices for medical management in the broader end-stage organ disease population should be prioritized to improve cardiovascular outcomes in these populations.",2022,Nov 2022,11/22/2022,36252095,PMC10124159,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001104,Circulation,Emerging Evidence on Coronary Heart Disease Screening in Kidney and Liver Transplantation Candidates: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association: Endorsed by the American Society of Transplantation.,e299,e324,146,21,Humans; American Heart Association; Coronary Artery Disease; Kidney Transplantation; Liver Transplantation; Mass Screening; United States; Clinical Trials as Topic,Coronary Artery Disease; Mass Screening,Humans; American Heart Association; Coronary Artery Disease/diagnosis; Kidney Transplantation; Liver Transplantation; Mass Screening; United States; Clinical Trials as Topic,AHA Scientific Statements; coronary angiography; coronary disease; exercise test; kidney transplantation; liver transplantation; mass screening; myocardial ischemia; risk evaluation and mitigation; risk factors,"Journal Article, Review"

Clinical care remains an important part of the academic mission; however, equally important are the educational and research missions. More specifically, the sustainability of health care in the United States relies on an educated and expertly trained physician workforce directly provided by academic medicine models. Similarly, the research charge to deliver innovation and discovery to improve health care and to cure disease is key to academic missions. Therefore, to support and promote the growth and sustainability of academic medicine, attracting and engaging top talent from fellows in training and early career faculty is of vital importance. However, as the health care needs of the nation have risen, clinicians have experienced unprecedented demand, and individual wellness and burnout have been examined more closely.

Objective To review observational and intervention research that examines the impact of social isolation and loneliness on cardiovascular and brain health and discuss proposed mechanisms for observed associations. Methods We conducted a systematic scoping review of available research. We searched 4 databases, PubMed, PsycInfo, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, and Scopus. Findings Evidence is most consistent for a direct association between social isolation, loneliness, and coronary heart disease and stroke mortality. However, data on the association between social isolation and loneliness with heart failure, dementia, and cognitive impairment are sparse and less robust. Few studies have empirically tested mediating pathways between social isolation, loneliness, and cardiovascular and brain health outcomes using appropriate methods for explanatory analyses. Notably, the effect estimates are small, and there may be unmeasured confounders of the associations. Research in groups that may be at higher risk or more vulnerable to the effects of social isolation is limited. We did not find any intervention studies that sought to reduce the adverse impact of social isolation or loneliness on cardiovascular or brain health outcomes. Conclusions Social isolation and loneliness are common and appear to be independent risk factors for worse cardiovascular and brain health; however, consistency of the associations varies by outcome. There is a need to develop, implement, and test interventions to improve cardiovascular and brain health for individuals who are socially isolated or lonely.",2022,Aug 2022,08/16/2022,35924775,PMC9496293,10.1161/JAHA.122.026493,Journal of the American Heart Association,Effects of Objective and Perceived Social Isolation on Cardiovascular and Brain Health: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e026493,e026493,11,16,American Heart Association; Brain; Humans; Loneliness; Risk Factors; Social Isolation,American Heart Association; Social Isolation,American Heart Association; Brain; Humans; Loneliness/psychology; Risk Factors; Social Isolation/psychology,AHA Scientific Statements; brain health; cardiovascular health; loneliness; social isolation,"Journal Article, Systematic Review"
