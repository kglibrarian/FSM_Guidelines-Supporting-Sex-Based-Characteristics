Rural-dwelling communities are particularly burdened by limited infrastructure and a higher prevalence of uncontrolled risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Geographic isolation and long distances to medical facilities hinder timely access to acute stroke care. Nurses in rural settings are vital across the stroke care continuum, including prevention, acute management, and poststroke rehabilitation. They provide community-based education, conduct assessments, stabilize patients, and facilitate rehabilitation. However, rural-dwelling nurses face challenges, including limited access to specialized education, staffing shortages, and geographic barriers, that hinder the delivery of expert stroke care. Telemedicine and artificial intelligence-driven clinical support tools transform rural stroke care by enabling real-time specialist consultations and predictive analytics and enhancing decision-making capabilities. Despite its potential, telemedicine adoption in rural areas remains limited because of infrastructure constraints, resulting primarily from the high cost that low-volume facilities often cannot afford. This scientific statement explores the essential role of rural-dwelling nurses in stroke care and the barriers they face. Key initiatives are identified to enhance stroke care in rural areas, including telemedicine, artificial intelligence, innovative education models, and data-driven quality improvement efforts. Last, implications and resources for targeted nursing interventions to improve rural stroke outcomes, including promoting access to care through telehealth, ensuring ongoing education for rural-dwelling nurses, and advocating for the creation of stroke coordinator and champion roles in rural hospitals, are highlighted.",2025,Oct 2025,10/30/2025,41164866,,10.1161/STR.0000000000000495,Stroke,Targeted Nursing Interventions for Improving Stroke Care and Outcomes in the Rural Setting: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,,,,,,,,AHA Scientific Statements; artificial intelligence; prevalence; risk factors; stroke; telemedicine,"Journal Article, Review"

Poor CR participation, which is a universal problem, is particularly pronounced in women. Considerable sex and gender disparities exist in CR access, engagement, and outcomes. Despite the effectiveness of CR, women are underrepresented in CR programs, and face barriers related to lower referral rates, medical comorbidities, societal roles, and financial constraints. These challenges are further compounded by racial and ethnic disparities. Women also have greater needs for specific aspects of CR, including mental health support and social integration. Traditional CR programs often fail to address these needs adequately, contributing to proportionally lower participation and completion rates among eligible women. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of CR programs in women, including women from underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, and to identify optimal CR approaches in specific populations, such as people with spontaneous coronary artery dissection, ischemia, myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy. To optimize CR participation and outcomes in women, a multifaceted approach is required. Strategies such as automatic referral systems, gender-sensitive program design, and mental health integration are essential. Further research is needed to determine the impact of nontraditional delivery models on women's cardiovascular health. Addressing these gaps can lead to improved cardiovascular health and quality of life for women with cardiovascular disease.",2025,Nov 2025,11/11/2025,41084821,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001379,Circulation,Cardiac Rehabilitation in Women: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e376,e390,152,19,Humans; Female; Cardiac Rehabilitation; United States; American Heart Association; Quality of Life; Healthcare Disparities; Women's Health; Sex Factors,Cardiac Rehabilitation; Women's Health,Humans; Female; Cardiac Rehabilitation/methods; United States/epidemiology; American Heart Association; Quality of Life; Healthcare Disparities; Women's Health; Sex Factors,AHA Scientific Statements; cardiac rehabilitation; cardiovascular diseases; exercise; sex; women,"Journal Article, Review"

Although previously considered a rare disease, increased awareness and noninvasive diagnostic methods have resulted in a rise in diagnoses. As a multisystem disease that affects multiple organ systems (cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, and neurological), there is significant overlap with both geriatric conditions and common conditions in heart failure. Frailty is recognized as a distinct biological syndrome of declines across multiple physiological systems, which prevents maintenance of homeostasis and limits the ability to respond to stressors. Frailty was initially characterized as physical frailty alone; however, it is increasingly recognized that it is multidimensional with components including nutrition, cognitive, psychological, and social. Frailty in cardiovascular disease has become an important risk factor, indicator for disease severity, and can help guide decisions around intervention. In certain patients, frailty may be reversible. Given the lack of consensus definitions, tools, and implementation of frailty in both clinical and research settings in the field of amyloidosis, we convened a group of experts from cardiology, geriatric cardiology, geriatrics, hematology, and allied health to form this state-of-the-art review. There are many points of intersectionality between amyloidosis, aging, and frailty which herald a need for multidisciplinary care.

Palliative care, with its specialized focus on alleviating suffering, aligns treatments with patient and caregiver values and improves overall care planning.

Because these patients are living longer, treatment and disease surveillance targets have shifted toward enhancing quality of life and functional status. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a valuable tool for assessing functional capacity, evaluating cardiac and pulmonary pathology, and providing guidance on prognosis and interventional recommendations. Despite the extensive evidence supporting the ability of cardiopulmonary exercise testing to quantitatively evaluate cardiovascular function, there remains confusion on how to properly interpret cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with congenital heart disease. The purpose of this statement is to provide a lifespan approach to the interpretation of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with congenital heart disease. This is an updated report of the American Heart Association's previous publications on exercise in children. This evidence-based update on the significance of cardiopulmonary exercise testing findings in pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with various congenital cardiac pathologies and surgically modified physiology is formatted in a way to guide cardiopulmonary exercise testing interpretation practically for the clinicians and exercise physiologists who care for patients with congenital heart disease.

Members of the writing group were chosen to represent the multidisciplinary team of professionals who care for people who have had a stroke. Each member was assigned a topic within their area of expertise, reviewed the literature, and drafted content with a focus on the past decade to complement the 2014 American Heart Association scientific statement on palliative and end-of-life care in stroke. Stroke has multidimensional effects on patients and their families because of threats to personhood, prognostic uncertainty, and the need to adapt to functional changes after stroke. Palliative care has evolved as both a specialty and a skillset with a goal to improve communication about goals of care and quality of life for patients and their families that emphasizes a holistic, all-person approach. After stroke, palliative care needs (eg, to address pain and physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual distress) are insufficiently addressed by current models of care. Integrating palliative care principles is fundamental in all stages of stroke and should include strategies to improve communication about prognosis and goals of care, address psychosocial needs such as coping with loss, navigating complex health care systems, and preparing for death when necessary. We also review strategies to address the substantial inequities that exist across sociodemographic and regional strata in the use of life-sustaining treatment and access to specialists in stroke or palliative care. Palliative care needs are common after stroke and should be addressed throughout the illness continuum.
