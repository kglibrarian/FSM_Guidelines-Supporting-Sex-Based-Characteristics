However, several prospective, randomized trials for atherosclerotic disease failed to demonstrate that renal revascularization is more effective than medical therapy for most patients. These results have greatly reduced the generalized diagnostic workup and use of renal revascularization. Most guidelines and review articles emphasize the limited average improvement and fail to identify those clinical populations that do benefit from revascularization. On the basis of the clinical experience of hypertension centers, specialists have continued selective revascularization, albeit without a summary statement by a major, multidisciplinary, national organization that identifies specific populations that may benefit. In this scientific statement for health care professionals and the public-at-large, we review the strengths and weaknesses of randomized trials in revascularization and highlight (1) when referral for consideration of diagnostic workup and therapy may be warranted, (2) the evidence/rationale for these selective scenarios, (3) interventional and surgical techniques for effective revascularization, and (4) areas of research with unmet need.",2022,Aug 2022,,35708012,PMC11731842,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000217,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",Revascularization for Renovascular Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e128,e143,79,8,"American Heart Association; Humans; Hypertension; Hypertension, Renovascular; Prospective Studies; Renal Artery Obstruction; Vascular Surgical Procedures","Hypertension; Hypertension, Renovascular; Renal Artery Obstruction","American Heart Association; Humans; Hypertension; Hypertension, Renovascular/diagnosis, etiology, surgery; Prospective Studies; Renal Artery Obstruction/diagnosis, surgery; Vascular Surgical Procedures","AHA Scientific Statements; heart failure; hypertension, renovascular; renal artery obstruction","Journal Article, Review"

However, the percentage of cases in which an individual receives bystander CPR is actually low, at only 35% to 40% globally. Preparing lay responders to recognize the signs of sudden cardiac arrest, call 9-1-1, and perform CPR in public and private locations is crucial to increasing survival from this public health problem. The objective of this scientific statement is to summarize the most recent published evidence about the lay responder experience of training, responding, and dealing with the residual impact of witnessing an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The scientific statement focuses on the experience-based literature of actual responders, which includes barriers to responding, experiences of doing CPR, use of an automated external defibrillator, the impact of dispatcher-assisted CPR, and the potential for postevent psychological sequelae. The large body of qualitative and observational studies identifies several gaps in crucial knowledge that, if targeted, could increase the likelihood that those who are trained in CPR will act. We suggest using the experience of actual responders to inform more contextualized training, including the implications of performing CPR on a family member, dispelling myths about harm, training and litigation, and recognition of the potential for psychologic sequelae after the event.",2022,Apr 2022,04/26/2022,35306832,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001054,Circulation,Understanding the Importance of the Lay Responder Experience in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e852,e867,145,17,"American Heart Association; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Defibrillators; Humans; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; United States",Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest,"American Heart Association; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/education; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Defibrillators; Humans; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/therapy; United States/epidemiology",AHA Scientific Statements; bystander; cardiac arrest; cardiopulmonary resuscitation,"Journal Article, Review, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

Drug interactions may be beneficial or detrimental to the desired therapeutic effect. Clinicians in both cardiology and oncology should be cognizant of these potential drug-drug interactions that may reduce the efficacy or safety of either cardiovascular or cancer therapies. These risks can be mitigated through increased recognition of potential drug-drug interaction, use of alternative medications when possible, and careful monitoring.
