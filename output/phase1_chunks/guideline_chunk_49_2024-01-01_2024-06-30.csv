In contrast, there is a lack of comparable evidence for guiding the management of elevated BP in the acute care setting, resulting in significant practice variation. Throughout this scientific statement, we use the terms acute care and inpatient to refer to care received in the emergency department and after admission to the hospital. Elevated inpatient BP is common and can manifest either as asymptomatic or with signs of new or worsening target-organ damage, a condition referred to as hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency involves acute target-organ damage and should be treated swiftly, usually with intravenous antihypertensive medications, in a closely monitored setting. However, the risk-benefit ratio of initiating or intensifying antihypertensive medications for asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP is less clear. Despite this ambiguity, clinicians prescribe oral or intravenous antihypertensive medications in approximately one-third of cases of asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP. Recent observational studies have suggested potential harms associated with treating asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP, which brings current practice into question. Despite the ubiquity of elevated inpatient BPs, few position papers, guidelines, or consensus statements have focused on improving BP management in the acute care setting. Therefore, this scientific statement aims to synthesize the available evidence, provide suggestions for best practice based on the available evidence, identify evidence-based gaps in managing elevated inpatient BP (asymptomatic and hypertensive emergency), and highlight areas requiring further research.",2024,Aug 2024,,38804130,,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000238,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",The Management of Elevated Blood Pressure in the Acute Care Setting: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e94,e106,81,8,Humans; Hypertension; Antihypertensive Agents; American Heart Association; United States; Blood Pressure; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Blood Pressure Determination,Hypertension; Antihypertensive Agents; American Heart Association,"Humans; Hypertension/diagnosis, drug therapy, physiopathology, therapy; Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use; American Heart Association; United States; Blood Pressure/physiology, drug effects; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Blood Pressure Determination/methods, standards",AHA Scientific Statements; antihypertensive agents; blood pressure; hospitalization; hypertension; inpatients,"Journal Article, Review"

Hypertension detection, treatment, and control vary worldwide; it is still low, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). High blood pressure (BP) and CVD risk have a strong, linear, and independent association. They contribute to alarming numbers of all-cause and CVD deaths. A major culprit for increased hypertension is sympathetic activity, and further complications of hypertension are heart failure, ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, and renal failure. Now, antihypertensive interventions have emerged as a global public health priority to reduce BP-related morbidity and mortality. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are highly effective vasodilators. and the most common drugs used for managing hypertension and CVD. Cilnidipine, with both L- and N-type calcium channel blocking activity, is a promising 4th generation CCB. It causes vasodilation via L-type calcium channel blockade and inhibits the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) via N-type calcium channel blockade. Cilnidipine, which acts as a dual L/N-type CCB, is linked to a reduced occurrence of pedal edema compared to amlodipine, which solely blocks L-type calcium channels. The antihypertensive properties of cilnidipine are very substantial, with low BP variability and long-acting properties. It is beneficial for hypertensive patients to deal with morning hypertension and for patients with abnormal nocturnal BP due to exaggerated sympathetic nerve activation. Besides its BP-lowering effect, it also exhibits organ protection via sympathetic nerve inhibition and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition; it controls heart rate and proteinuria. Reno-protective, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects of cilnidipine have been well-documented and demonstrated.",2024,Jan 2024,,38736080,,10.59556/japi.71.0400,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,"The Promise of Cilnidipine in Hypertension with Comorbidities: National Consensus Statement: National Consensus Group Comprises Cardiologists, Nephrologists, and Diabetologists from India in a National Meet at New Delhi held on 22<sup>nd</sup> May 2022.",88,95,72,1,Humans; Hypertension; Calcium Channel Blockers; Dihydropyridines; India; Antihypertensive Agents; Consensus; Comorbidity,Hypertension; Calcium Channel Blockers; Dihydropyridines,Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy; Calcium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use; Dihydropyridines/therapeutic use; India/epidemiology; Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use; Consensus; Comorbidity,,"Journal Article, Consensus Development Conference"

Over the past several decades, the prevalence of cardiac sarcoidosis has increased. Definitive histological confirmation is often not possible, so clinicians frequently face uncertainty about the accuracy of diagnosis. Hence, the likelihood of cardiac sarcoidosis should be thought of as a continuum (definite, highly probable, probable, possible, low probability, unlikely) rather than in a binary fashion. Treatment should be initiated in individuals with clinical manifestations and active inflammation in a tiered approach, with corticosteroids as first-line treatment. The lack of randomized clinical trials in cardiac sarcoidosis has led to treatment decisions based on cohort studies and consensus opinions, with substantial variation observed across centers.

Older adults have been largely excluded from analyses of therapeutic options in patients with cardiogenic shock. As a result, despite the association of advanced age with worse outcomes, focused strategies in the assessment and management of cardiogenic shock in this high-risk and growing population are lacking. Individual programs oftentimes develop upper age limits for various interventional strategies for their patients, including heart transplantation and durable left ventricular assist devices.
