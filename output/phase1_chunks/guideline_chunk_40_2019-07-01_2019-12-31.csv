This advisory was developed after a review of human studies on the relationship of dietary cholesterol with blood lipids, lipoproteins, and cardiovascular disease risk to address questions about the relevance of dietary cholesterol guidance for heart health. Evidence from observational studies conducted in several countries generally does not indicate a significant association with cardiovascular disease risk. Although meta-analyses of intervention studies differ in their findings, most associate intakes of cholesterol that exceed current average levels with elevated total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Dietary guidance should focus on healthy dietary patterns (eg, Mediterranean-style and DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]-style diets) that are inherently relatively low in cholesterol with typical levels similar to the current US intake. These patterns emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, lean protein sources, nuts, seeds, and liquid vegetable oils. A recommendation that gives a specific dietary cholesterol target within the context of food-based advice is challenging for clinicians and consumers to implement; hence, guidance focused on dietary patterns is more likely to improve diet quality and to promote cardiovascular health.",2020,Jan 2020,01/21/2020,31838890,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000743,Circulation,Dietary Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Risk: A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association.,e39,e53,141,3,"Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol, Dietary; Diet, Western; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Recommended Dietary Allowances","Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol, Dietary; Diet, Western; Nutrition Policy; Recommended Dietary Allowances","Cardiovascular Diseases/blood, etiology, prevention & control; Cholesterol, Dietary/administration & dosage, adverse effects; Diet, Western; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Recommended Dietary Allowances",AHA Scientific Statements; cholesterol; diet; eggs; risk factors,"Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review"

Older adults with cardiovascular disease are frequently admitted to cardiac intensive care units (CICUs), where care is commensurate with high age-related cardiovascular disease risks but where the associated geriatric conditions (including multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive decline and delirium, and frailty) may be inadvertently exacerbated and destabilized. The CICU environment of procedures, new medications, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, prolonged bed rest, malnourishment, and sleep is usually inherently disruptive to older patients regardless of the excellence of cardiovascular disease care. Given these fundamental and broad challenges of patient aging, CICU management priorities and associated decision-making are particularly complex and in need of enhancements. In this American Heart Association statement, we examine age-related risks and describe some of the distinctive dynamics pertinent to older adults and emerging opportunities to enhance CICU care. Relevant assessment tools are discussed, as well as the need for additional clinical research to best advance CICU care for the already dominating and still expanding population of older adults.",2020,Jan 2020,01/14/2020,31813278,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000741,Circulation,"Older Adults in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit: Factoring Geriatric Syndromes in the Management, Prognosis, and Process of Care: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.",e6,e32,141,2,Aged; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases; Decision Making; Delirium; Disease Management; Energy Intake; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Middle Aged; Multimorbidity; Polypharmacy; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Transitional Care; United States,Geriatric Assessment,"Aged; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases/pathology, therapy; Decision Making; Delirium/pathology; Disease Management; Energy Intake; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Middle Aged; Multimorbidity; Polypharmacy; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Transitional Care; United States",AHA Scientific Statements; aged; aging; bed rest; cardiovascular diseases; cognition; confusion; decision making; delirium; dementia; frailty; multimorbidity; polypharmacy; resuscitation orders; sarcopenia,Journal Article
