Over the past 50 years, the prevalence of CVD has been rising among American Indians and Alaska Natives. The objective of this statement is to summarize population-level risk factors and management techniques tailored for the American Indian and Alaska Native populations. PubMed/MEDLINE, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the annual Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics report from the American Heart Association were used to identify risk factors and interventions specific to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Diabetes mellitus is a major contributor to disproportionately higher rates of coronary heart disease among American Indians and Alaska Natives compared with other racial and ethnic groups. Additional risk factors for CVD include low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, hypertension, renal disease, age, and sex. Smoking and exposure to toxic metals are risk factors for some subpopulations. A quarter of American Indians live below the federal poverty line, and thus, low socioeconomic status is an important social determinant of cardiovascular health. Community-based interventions have reduced CVD risk in American Indians and Alaska Natives. Underreporting of American Indian and Alaska Native race could underestimate the extent of CVD in this population. Prevention and treatment of CVD in American Indians and Alaska Natives should focus on control of risk factors and community-based interventions that address social determinants of health, particularly among individuals with diabetes mellitus. Accurate reporting of race/ethnicity is encouraged to address race-specific risk factors.",2020,Jun 2020,06/23/2020,32460555,PMC7351358,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000773,Circulation,Cardiovascular Health in American Indians and Alaska Natives: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e948,e959,141,25,Alaska Natives; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena; Disease Management; Disease Susceptibility; Ethnicity; Health Status; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Public Health Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; American Indian or Alaska Native,Alaska Natives; Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena; Health Status; American Indian or Alaska Native,"Alaska Natives; Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis, epidemiology, etiology, therapy; Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena; Disease Management; Disease Susceptibility; Ethnicity; Health Status; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Public Health Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; American Indian or Alaska Native",AHA Scientific Statements; Alaska Natives; American Indians; cardiovascular disease; coronary heart disease; healthcare disparities,"Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

,,,,,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy constitute one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality worldwide. It has been estimated that preeclampsia complicates 2-8% of pregnancies globally (). In Latin America and the Caribbean, hypertensive disorders are responsible for almost 26% of maternal deaths, whereas in Africa and Asia they contribute to 9% of deaths. Although maternal mortality is much lower in high-income countries than in developing countries, 16% of maternal deaths can be attributed to hypertensive disorders (). In the United States, the rate of preeclampsia increased by 25% between 1987 and 2004 (). Moreover, in comparison with women giving birth in 1980, those giving birth in 2003 were at 6.7-fold increased risk of severe preeclampsia (). This complication is costly: one study reported that in 2012 in the United States, the estimated cost of preeclampsia within the first 12 months of delivery was $2.18 billion ($1.03 billion for women and $1.15 billion for infants), which was disproportionately borne by premature births ().

Great strides have been made in stroke prevention and rhythm control strategies, yet reducing the incidence of AF has been slowed by the increasing incidence and prevalence of AF risk factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other modifiable lifestyle-related factors. Fortunately, many of these AF drivers are potentially reversible, and emerging evidence supports that addressing these modifiable risks may be effective for primary and secondary AF prevention. A structured, protocol-driven multidisciplinary approach to integrate lifestyle and risk factor management as an integral part of AF management may help in the prevention and treatment of AF. However, this aspect of AF management is currently underrecognized, underused, and understudied. The purpose of this American Heart Association scientific statement is to review the association of modifiable risk factors with AF and the effects of risk factor intervention. Implementation strategies, care pathways, and educational links for achieving impactful weight reduction, increased physical activity, and risk factor modification are included. Implications for clinical practice, gaps in knowledge, and future directions for the research community are highlighted.",2020,Apr 2020,04/21/2020,32148086,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000748,Circulation,Lifestyle and Risk Factor Modification for Reduction of Atrial Fibrillation: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e750,e772,141,16,American Heart Association; Atrial Fibrillation; Humans; Life Style; Patient Education as Topic; Risk Factors; United States,Atrial Fibrillation; Life Style; Patient Education as Topic,"American Heart Association; Atrial Fibrillation/epidemiology, physiopathology, therapy; Humans; Life Style; Patient Education as Topic; Risk Factors; United States/epidemiology",AHA Scientific Statements; atrial fibrillation; exercise; lifestyle; obesity; risk factors; weight loss,"Journal Article, Review"

This expert consensus decision pathway emphasizes that recognition of MR should prompt an assessment of its etiology, mechanism, and severity, as well as consideration of the indications for treatment. The document is a focused update of the 2017 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Management of Mitral Regurgitation, with some sections updated and others added in light of the publication of new trial data related to secondary MR, among other developments. A structured approach to evaluation based on clinical findings, accurate echocardiographic imaging, and, when necessary, adjunctive testing can help clarify decision making.

This advisory was developed after a review of human studies on the relationship of dietary cholesterol with blood lipids, lipoproteins, and cardiovascular disease risk to address questions about the relevance of dietary cholesterol guidance for heart health. Evidence from observational studies conducted in several countries generally does not indicate a significant association with cardiovascular disease risk. Although meta-analyses of intervention studies differ in their findings, most associate intakes of cholesterol that exceed current average levels with elevated total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Dietary guidance should focus on healthy dietary patterns (eg, Mediterranean-style and DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]-style diets) that are inherently relatively low in cholesterol with typical levels similar to the current US intake. These patterns emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, lean protein sources, nuts, seeds, and liquid vegetable oils. A recommendation that gives a specific dietary cholesterol target within the context of food-based advice is challenging for clinicians and consumers to implement; hence, guidance focused on dietary patterns is more likely to improve diet quality and to promote cardiovascular health.",2020,Jan 2020,01/21/2020,31838890,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000743,Circulation,Dietary Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Risk: A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association.,e39,e53,141,3,"Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol, Dietary; Diet, Western; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Recommended Dietary Allowances","Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol, Dietary; Diet, Western; Nutrition Policy; Recommended Dietary Allowances","Cardiovascular Diseases/blood, etiology, prevention & control; Cholesterol, Dietary/administration & dosage, adverse effects; Diet, Western; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Recommended Dietary Allowances",AHA Scientific Statements; cholesterol; diet; eggs; risk factors,"Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review"
"Damluji AA, Forman DE, van Diepen S, Alexander KP, Page RL, Hummel SL, Menon V, Katz JN, Albert NM, Afilalo J, Cohen MG, American Heart Association Council on Clinical Cardiology and Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing",,,,[''],"Longevity is increasing, and more adults are living to the stage of life when age-related biological factors determine a higher likelihood of cardiovascular disease in a distinctive context of concurrent geriatric conditions. Older adults with cardiovascular disease are frequently admitted to cardiac intensive care units (CICUs), where care is commensurate with high age-related cardiovascular disease risks but where the associated geriatric conditions (including multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive decline and delirium, and frailty) may be inadvertently exacerbated and destabilized. The CICU environment of procedures, new medications, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, prolonged bed rest, malnourishment, and sleep is usually inherently disruptive to older patients regardless of the excellence of cardiovascular disease care. Given these fundamental and broad challenges of patient aging, CICU management priorities and associated decision-making are particularly complex and in need of enhancements. In this American Heart Association statement, we examine age-related risks and describe some of the distinctive dynamics pertinent to older adults and emerging opportunities to enhance CICU care. Relevant assessment tools are discussed, as well as the need for additional clinical research to best advance CICU care for the already dominating and still expanding population of older adults.",2020,Jan 2020,01/14/2020,31813278,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000741,Circulation,"Older Adults in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit: Factoring Geriatric Syndromes in the Management, Prognosis, and Process of Care: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.",e6,e32,141,2,Aged; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases; Decision Making; Delirium; Disease Management; Energy Intake; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Middle Aged; Multimorbidity; Polypharmacy; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Transitional Care; United States,Geriatric Assessment,"Aged; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases/pathology, therapy; Decision Making; Delirium/pathology; Disease Management; Energy Intake; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Middle Aged; Multimorbidity; Polypharmacy; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Transitional Care; United States",AHA Scientific Statements; aged; aging; bed rest; cardiovascular diseases; cognition; confusion; decision making; delirium; dementia; frailty; multimorbidity; polypharmacy; resuscitation orders; sarcopenia,Journal Article
