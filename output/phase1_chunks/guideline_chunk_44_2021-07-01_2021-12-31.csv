An increasing number of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) who develop medium and large coronary artery aneurysms (classified by the American Heart Association according to maximal internal coronary artery diameter Z-scores ≥5 and ≥10, respectively) are becoming adults and thus undergoing an HCT. However, a poor transition to an adult provider represents a risk of loss to follow-up, which can result in increasing morbidity and mortality. Methods and Results This scientific statement provides a summary of available literature and expert opinion pertaining to KD and HCT of children as they reach adulthood. The statement reviews the existing life-long risks for patients with KD, explains current guidelines for long-term care of patients with KD, and offers guidance on assessment and preparation of patients with KD for HCT. The key element to a successful HCT, enabling successful transition outcomes, is having a structured intervention that incorporates the components of planning, transfer, and integration into adult care. This structured intervention can be accomplished by using the Six Core Elements approach that is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians. Conclusions Formal HCT programs for patients with KD who develop aneurysms should be established to ensure a smooth transition with uninterrupted medical care as these youths become adults.",2021,Oct 2021,10/19/2021,34632822,PMC8751858,10.1161/JAHA.121.023310,Journal of the American Heart Association,Falling Through the Cracks: The Current Gap in the Health Care Transition of Patients With Kawasaki Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e023310,e023310,10,20,Adolescent; Adult; American Heart Association; Child; Humans; Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome; Transition to Adult Care; United States,Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome; Transition to Adult Care,Adolescent; Adult; American Heart Association; Child; Humans; Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome/therapy; Transition to Adult Care/organization & administration; United States,AHA Scientific Statements; Kawasaki disease; coronary artery aneurysms; health care transition; transition of care,Journal Article

However, oxygen availability declines at altitude, and hypoxic environments place unique stressors on the cardiovascular system. These stressors may be exacerbated by exercise at altitude, because exercise increases oxygen demand in an environment that is already relatively oxygen deplete compared with sea-level conditions. Furthermore, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, as well as diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, and lung disease, is high among individuals living in the United States. As such, patients who are at risk of or who have established cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of adverse events when sojourning to these mountainous locations. However, these risks may be minimized by appropriate pretravel assessments and planning through shared decision-making between patients and their managing clinicians. This American Heart Association scientific statement provides a concise, yet comprehensive overview of the physiologic responses to exercise in hypoxic locations, as well as important considerations for minimizing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events during mountainous excursions.",2021,Oct 2021,10/05/2021,34496612,PMC8649141,10.1161/JAHA.121.023225,Journal of the American Heart Association,Clinical Implications for Exercise at Altitude Among Individuals With Cardiovascular Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e023225,e023225,10,19,Altitude; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Hypoxia; Oxygen; Risk Factors; United States,American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases,"Altitude; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology, prevention & control; Humans; Hypoxia; Oxygen; Risk Factors; United States/epidemiology",AHA Scientific Statements; altitude; cardiovascular diseases; exercise; heart failure; hypertension; sudden cardiac death; syncope,"Journal Article, Review"
"Chow SL, Sasson C, Benjamin IJ, Califf RM, Compton WM, Oliva EM, Robson C, Sanchez EJ",,,,[''],"The misuse of opioids continues to be epidemic, resulting in dependency and a recent upsurge in drug overdoses that have contributed to a significant decrease in life expectancy in the United States. Moreover, recent data suggest that commonly used opioids for the management of pain may produce undesirable pharmacological actions and interfere with critical medications commonly used in cardiovascular disease and stroke; however, the impact on outcomes remains controversial. The American Heart Association developed an advisory statement for health care professionals and researchers in the setting of cardiovascular and brain health to synthesize the current literature, to provide approaches for identifying patients with opioid use disorder, and to address pain management and overdose. A literature and internet search spanning from January 1, 2012, to February 15, 2021, and limited to epidemiology studies, reviews, consensus statements, and guidelines in human subjects was conducted. Suggestions and considerations listed in this document are based primarily on published evidence from this review whenever possible, as well as expert opinion. Several federal and institutional consensus documents and clinical resources are currently available to both patients and clinicians; however, none have specifically addressed cardiovascular disease and brain health. Although strategic tools and therapeutic approaches for recognition of opioid use disorder and safe opioid use are available for health care professionals who manage patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke, high-quality evidence does not currently exist. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more research to identify the most effective approaches to improve care for these patients.",2021,Sep 2021,09/28/2021,34407637,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001007,Circulation,Opioid Use and Its Relationship to Cardiovascular Disease and Brain Health: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.,e218,e232,144,13,"Adult; Analgesics, Opioid; Brain; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged",,"Adult; Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacology, therapeutic use; Brain/drug effects; Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged","AHA Scientific Statements; analgesics, opioid; brain; cardiovascular diseases; guideline; opioid-related disorders; stroke","Journal Article, Review"

It is associated with incident systemic hypertension, arrhythmia, stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. OSA is common in children and adolescents, but there has been less focus on OSA as a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents. This scientific statement summarizes what is known regarding the impact of sleep-disordered breathing and, in particular, OSA on the cardiovascular health of children and adolescents. This statement highlights what is known regarding the impact of OSA on the risk for hypertension, arrhythmia, abnormal ventricular morphology, impaired ventricular contractility, and elevated right heart pressure among children and adolescents.

Despite its prevalence and clinical importance, PAD has been historically underappreciated by health care professionals and patients. This underappreciation seems multifactorial (eg, limited availability of the first-line diagnostic test, the ankle-brachial index, in clinics; incorrect perceptions that a leg vascular disease is not fatal and that the diagnosis of PAD would not necessarily change clinical practice). In the past several years, a body of evidence has indicated that these perceptions are incorrect. Several studies have consistently demonstrated that many patients with PAD are not receiving evidence-based therapies. Thus, this scientific statement provides an update for health care professionals regarding contemporary epidemiology (eg, prevalence, temporal trends, risk factors, and complications) of PAD, the present status of diagnosis (physiological tests and imaging modalities), and the major gaps in the management of PAD (eg, medications, exercise therapy, and revascularization). The statement also lists key gaps in research, clinical practice, and implementation related to PAD. Orchestrated efforts among different parties (eg, health care providers, researchers, expert organizations, and health care organizations) will be needed to increase the awareness and understanding of PAD and improve the diagnostic approaches, management, and prognosis of PAD.",2021,Aug 2021,08/31/2021,34315230,PMC9847212,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001005,Circulation,"Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease: Contemporary Epidemiology, Management Gaps, and Future Directions: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.",e171,e191,144,9,"American Heart Association; Atherosclerosis; Combined Modality Therapy; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Disease Management; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity; Male; Mass Screening; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Prevalence; Prognosis; Public Health Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States",Lower Extremity,"American Heart Association; Atherosclerosis/diagnosis, epidemiology, etiology, therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Disease Management; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Humans; Lower Extremity/blood supply, pathology; Male; Mass Screening; Peripheral Arterial Disease/diagnosis, epidemiology, etiology, therapy; Prevalence; Prognosis; Public Health Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States/epidemiology",AHA Scientific Statements; diagnosis; epidemiology; peripheral artery disease; prognosis; risk factors,"Journal Article, Review"

For patients with mildly or moderately elevated blood pressure and blood cholesterol, lifestyle-only approaches are the first line of therapy. The purpose of this scientific statement is to: (1) highlight the mild-moderate-risk patient groups indicated for lifestyle-only treatment for elevated blood pressure or cholesterol; (2) describe recommendations, average effects, and additional considerations when prescribing lifestyle treatment with physical activity; and (3) provide guidance and resources for clinicians to assess, prescribe, counsel, and refer to support increased physical activity in their patients. An estimated 21% and 28% to 37% of US adults, respectively, have mild-moderate-risk blood pressure and cholesterol and should receive lifestyle-only as first-line treatment. Of the recommended lifestyle changes, increasing physical activity has extensive benefits, including improving both blood pressure and blood cholesterol, that are comparable, superior, or complementary to other healthy lifestyle changes. Physical activity assessment and prescription are an excellent lifestyle behavior treatment option for all patients, including for the large population of mild-moderate-risk patients with elevated blood pressure and blood cholesterol.",2021,Aug 2021,,34074137,,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000196,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)","Physical Activity as a Critical Component of First-Line Treatment for Elevated Blood Pressure or Cholesterol: Who, What, and How?: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.",e26,e37,78,2,American Heart Association; Exercise; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Hypertension; Life Style; United States,American Heart Association; Exercise,American Heart Association; Exercise; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia/therapy; Hypertension/therapy; Life Style; United States,AHA Scientific Statements; blood pressure; exercise; hypertension; lifestyle; risk reduction behavior,Journal Article

The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association convened an evidence review committee to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of DAPT compared with SAPT for secondary ischemic stroke prevention. The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on December 5, 2019, to identify phase III or IV randomized controlled trials (n≥100) from December 1999 to December 2019. We calculated unadjusted relative risks (RRs) and performed meta-analyses of studies based on the duration of treatment (short [≤90 days] versus long [>90 days]). Three short-duration randomized controlled trials were identified that enrolled mostly patients with minor stroke or high risk transient ischemic attack. In these trials, DAPT, compared with SAPT, was associated with a lower 90-day risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55-0.83], <i>I </i><sup>2</sup>=37.1%). There was no significant increase in major bleeding with DAPT in short-duration trials (pooled RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93-3.83], <i>I </i><sup>2</sup>=8.9%). In 2 long-duration treatment randomized controlled trials (mean treatment duration, 18-40 months), DAPT was not associated with a significant reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79-1.02], <i>I </i><sup>2</sup>=1.4%), but was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (pooled RR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.37-4.30], <i>I </i><sup>2</sup>=75.5%). DAPT was more effective than SAPT for prevention of secondary ischemic stroke when initiated early after the onset of minor stroke/high-risk transient ischemic attack and treatment duration was <90 days. However, when the treatment duration was longer and initiated later after stroke or transient ischemic attack onset, DAPT was not more effective than SAPT for ischemic stroke prevention and it increased the risk of bleeding.",2021,Jul 2021,,34024115,,10.1161/STR.0000000000000377,Stroke,Benefits and Risks of Dual Versus Single Antiplatelet Therapy for Secondary Stroke Prevention: A Systematic Review for the 2021 Guideline for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack.,e468,e479,52,7,"Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Assessment; Secondary Prevention; Stroke",,"Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy/methods, standards; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient/epidemiology, prevention & control; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/administration & dosage; Practice Guidelines as Topic/standards; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods, standards; Risk Assessment; Secondary Prevention/methods, standards; Stroke/epidemiology, prevention & control","AHA Scientific Statements; dual antiplatelet therapy; ischemic attack, transient; ischemic stroke","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review"
