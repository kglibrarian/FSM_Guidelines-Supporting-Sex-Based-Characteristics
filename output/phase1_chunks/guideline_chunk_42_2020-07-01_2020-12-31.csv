The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and multiple others have been reminders that structural racism persists and restricts the opportunities for long, healthy lives of Black Americans and other historically disenfranchised groups. The American Heart Association has previously published statements addressing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk and disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the United States, but these statements have not adequately recognized structural racism as a fundamental cause of poor health and disparities in cardiovascular disease. This presidential advisory reviews the historical context, current state, and potential solutions to address structural racism in our country. Several principles emerge from our review: racism persists; racism is experienced; and the task of dismantling racism must belong to all of society. It cannot be accomplished by affected individuals alone. The path forward requires our commitment to transforming the conditions of historically marginalized communities, improving the quality of housing and neighborhood environments of these populations, advocating for policies that eliminate inequities in access to economic opportunities, quality education, and health care, and enhancing allyship among racial and ethnic groups. Future research on racism must be accelerated and should investigate the joint effects of multiple domains of racism (structural, interpersonal, cultural, anti-Black). The American Heart Association must look internally to correct its own shortcomings and advance antiracist policies and practices regarding science, public and professional education, and advocacy. With this advisory, the American Heart Association declares its unequivocal support of antiracist principles.",2020,Dec 2020,12/15/2020,33170755,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000936,Circulation,Call to Action: Structural Racism as a Fundamental Driver of Health Disparities: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.,e454,e468,142,24,American Heart Association; Delivery of Health Care; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Quality of Health Care; Racism; Stroke; United States,American Heart Association; Healthcare Disparities; Racism,American Heart Association; Delivery of Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Quality of Health Care; Racism; Stroke/therapy; United States,AHA Scientific Statements; cardiovascular diseases; cerebrovascular disorders; health equity; health status disparities; healthcare disparities; racism,"Journal Article, Review"

Part 7 of the <i>2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care</i> focuses on systems of care, with an emphasis on elements that are relevant to a broad range of resuscitation situations. Previous systems of care guidelines have identified a Chain of Survival, beginning with prevention and early identification of cardiac arrest and proceeding through resuscitation to post-cardiac arrest care. This concept is reinforced by the addition of recovery as an important stage in cardiac arrest survival. Debriefing and other quality improvement strategies were previously mentioned and are now emphasized. Specific to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, this Part contains recommendations about community initiatives to promote cardiac arrest recognition, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, public access defibrillation, mobile phone technologies to summon first responders, and an enhanced role for emergency telecommunicators. Germane to in-hospital cardiac arrest are recommendations about the recognition and stabilization of hospital patients at risk for developing cardiac arrest. This Part also includes recommendations about clinical debriefing, transport to specialized cardiac arrest centers, organ donation, and performance measurement across the continuum of resuscitation situations.",2020,Oct 2020,10/20/2020,33081524,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000899,Circulation,Part 7: Systems of Care: 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.,S580,S604,142,16_suppl_2,"Advanced Cardiac Life Support; American Heart Association; Cardiology; Cardiology Service, Hospital; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Consensus; Cooperative Behavior; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Emergencies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Evidence-Based Medicine; Heart Arrest; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Patient Care Team; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States",,"Advanced Cardiac Life Support/standards; American Heart Association; Cardiology/standards; Cardiology Service, Hospital/standards; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/adverse effects, standards; Consensus; Cooperative Behavior; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated/standards; Emergencies; Emergency Service, Hospital/standards; Evidence-Based Medicine/standards; Heart Arrest/diagnosis, physiopathology, therapy; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Patient Care Team/standards; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States",AHA Scientific Statements; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; delivery of health care; emergency medical dispatcher; hospital rapid response team; organ transplantation; patient care team; quality improvement,"Journal Article, Practice Guideline, Systematic Review"

These disparities are posited to be driven primarily by exposure to psychosocial stressors across the life span. This American Heart Association scientific statement reviews the extant literature on the cardiovascular health of LGBTQ adults. Informed by the minority stress and social ecological models, the objectives of this statement were (1) to present a conceptual model to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying cardiovascular health disparities in LGBTQ adults, (2) to identify research gaps, and (3) to provide suggestions for improving cardiovascular research and care of LGBTQ people. Despite the identified methodological limitations, there is evidence that LGBTQ adults (particularly lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women) experience disparities across several cardiovascular health metrics. These disparities vary by race, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Future research in this area should incorporate longitudinal designs, elucidate physiological mechanisms, assess social and clinical determinants of cardiovascular health, and identify potential targets for behavioral interventions. There is a need to develop and test interventions that address multilevel stressors that affect the cardiovascular health of LGBTQ adults. Content on LGBTQ health should be integrated into health professions curricula and continuing education for practicing clinicians. Advancing the cardiovascular health of LGBTQ adults requires a multifaceted approach that includes stakeholders from multiple sectors to integrate best practices into health promotion and cardiovascular care of this population.",2020,Nov 2020,11/10/2020,33028085,PMC8212867,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000914,Circulation,Assessing and Addressing Cardiovascular Health in LGBTQ Adults: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e321,e332,142,19,Adult; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Intersex Persons; Male; Sexual Behavior; Transgender Persons; United States,Cardiovascular Diseases; Healthcare Disparities; Intersex Persons; Sexual Behavior; Transgender Persons,Adult; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Intersex Persons; Male; Sexual Behavior; Transgender Persons; United States,AHA Scientific Statements; cardiovascular diseases; cultural competency; data collection; health promotion; sexual and gender minorities; social discrimination; transgender persons,Journal Article

The impact of the US Surgeon General's <i>The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism</i> in 2008 has been lower than expected given the public health impact of this disease. This scientific statement highlights future research priorities in venous thromboembolism, developed by experts and a crowdsourcing survey across 16 scientific organizations. At the fundamental research level (T0), researchers need to identify pathobiological causative mechanisms for the 50% of patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism and to better understand mechanisms that differentiate hemostasis from thrombosis. At the human level (T1), new methods for diagnosing, treating, and preventing venous thromboembolism will allow tailoring of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to individuals. At the patient level (T2), research efforts are required to understand how foundational evidence impacts care of patients (eg, biomarkers). New treatments, such as catheter-based therapies, require further testing to identify which patients are most likely to experience benefit. At the practice level (T3), translating evidence into practice remains challenging. Areas of overuse and underuse will require evidence-based tools to improve care delivery. At the community and population level (T4), public awareness campaigns need thorough impact assessment. Large population-based cohort studies can elucidate the biological and environmental underpinnings of venous thromboembolism and its complications. To achieve these goals, funding agencies and training programs must support a new generation of scientists and clinicians who work in multidisciplinary teams to solve the pressing public health problem of venous thromboembolism.",2020,Aug 2020,08/11/2020,32776842,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000818,Circulation,Venous Thromboembolism Research Priorities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.,e85,e94,142,6,"American Heart Association; Biomarkers; Evidence-Based Medicine; Expert Testimony; Hemostasis; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Research; Thrombosis; Translational Research, Biomedical; United States; Venous Thromboembolism",,"American Heart Association; Biomarkers; Evidence-Based Medicine; Expert Testimony; Hemostasis/physiology; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Research; Thrombosis/diagnosis; Translational Research, Biomedical; United States; Venous Thromboembolism/diagnosis, therapy",AHA Scientific Statements; hemostasis; postthrombotic syndrome; pulmonary embolism; research priorities; thrombosis; venous thromboembolism; venous thrombosis,"Journal Article, Review"
