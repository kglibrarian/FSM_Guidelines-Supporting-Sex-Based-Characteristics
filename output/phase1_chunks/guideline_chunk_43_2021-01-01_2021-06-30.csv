However, although some practices have emerged based on evidence, many traditions have persisted based on beliefs and theoretical concerns. The aim of this review is to highlight common preprocedure, intraprocedure, and postprocedure catheterization laboratory practices where evidence has accumulated over the past few decades to support or discount traditionally held practices.",2021,Aug 2021,08/03/2021,34187171,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000996,Circulation,Evidence-Based Practices in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e107,e119,144,5,"American Heart Association; Cardiac Catheterization; Clinical Laboratory Services; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Laboratories, Clinical; Perioperative Care; United States",Cardiac Catheterization; Evidence-Based Medicine,"American Heart Association; Cardiac Catheterization/methods, standards; Clinical Laboratory Services; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Evidence-Based Medicine/methods, standards; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Laboratories, Clinical; Perioperative Care/methods, standards; United States",AHA Scientific Statements; cardiac catheterization; evidence based; percutaneous coronary intervention,"Journal Article, Review"

For patients with mildly or moderately elevated blood pressure and blood cholesterol, lifestyle-only approaches are the first line of therapy. The purpose of this scientific statement is to: (1) highlight the mild-moderate-risk patient groups indicated for lifestyle-only treatment for elevated blood pressure or cholesterol; (2) describe recommendations, average effects, and additional considerations when prescribing lifestyle treatment with physical activity; and (3) provide guidance and resources for clinicians to assess, prescribe, counsel, and refer to support increased physical activity in their patients. An estimated 21% and 28% to 37% of US adults, respectively, have mild-moderate-risk blood pressure and cholesterol and should receive lifestyle-only as first-line treatment. Of the recommended lifestyle changes, increasing physical activity has extensive benefits, including improving both blood pressure and blood cholesterol, that are comparable, superior, or complementary to other healthy lifestyle changes. Physical activity assessment and prescription are an excellent lifestyle behavior treatment option for all patients, including for the large population of mild-moderate-risk patients with elevated blood pressure and blood cholesterol.",2021,Aug 2021,,34074137,,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000196,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)","Physical Activity as a Critical Component of First-Line Treatment for Elevated Blood Pressure or Cholesterol: Who, What, and How?: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.",e26,e37,78,2,American Heart Association; Exercise; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Hypertension; Life Style; United States,American Heart Association; Exercise,American Heart Association; Exercise; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia/therapy; Hypertension/therapy; Life Style; United States,AHA Scientific Statements; blood pressure; exercise; hypertension; lifestyle; risk reduction behavior,Journal Article

The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association convened an evidence review committee to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of DAPT compared with SAPT for secondary ischemic stroke prevention. The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on December 5, 2019, to identify phase III or IV randomized controlled trials (n≥100) from December 1999 to December 2019. We calculated unadjusted relative risks (RRs) and performed meta-analyses of studies based on the duration of treatment (short [≤90 days] versus long [>90 days]). Three short-duration randomized controlled trials were identified that enrolled mostly patients with minor stroke or high risk transient ischemic attack. In these trials, DAPT, compared with SAPT, was associated with a lower 90-day risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55-0.83], <i>I </i><sup>2</sup>=37.1%). There was no significant increase in major bleeding with DAPT in short-duration trials (pooled RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93-3.83], <i>I </i><sup>2</sup>=8.9%). In 2 long-duration treatment randomized controlled trials (mean treatment duration, 18-40 months), DAPT was not associated with a significant reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79-1.02], <i>I </i><sup>2</sup>=1.4%), but was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (pooled RR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.37-4.30], <i>I </i><sup>2</sup>=75.5%). DAPT was more effective than SAPT for prevention of secondary ischemic stroke when initiated early after the onset of minor stroke/high-risk transient ischemic attack and treatment duration was <90 days. However, when the treatment duration was longer and initiated later after stroke or transient ischemic attack onset, DAPT was not more effective than SAPT for ischemic stroke prevention and it increased the risk of bleeding.",2021,Jul 2021,,34024115,,10.1161/STR.0000000000000377,Stroke,Benefits and Risks of Dual Versus Single Antiplatelet Therapy for Secondary Stroke Prevention: A Systematic Review for the 2021 Guideline for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack.,e468,e479,52,7,"Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Assessment; Secondary Prevention; Stroke",,"Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy/methods, standards; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient/epidemiology, prevention & control; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/administration & dosage; Practice Guidelines as Topic/standards; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods, standards; Risk Assessment; Secondary Prevention/methods, standards; Stroke/epidemiology, prevention & control","AHA Scientific Statements; dual antiplatelet therapy; ischemic attack, transient; ischemic stroke","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review"

Cardiovascular toxicity associated with cancer therapy can manifest as a broad range of potentially life-threatening complications, including heart failure, arrhythmia, myocarditis, and vascular events. Beyond toxicology, the intersection of cancer and heart disease has blossomed to include discovery of genetic and environmental risk factors that predispose to both. There is a pressing need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity to improve outcomes in patients with cancer. Preclinical cardiovascular models, ranging from cellular assays to large animals, serve as the foundation for mechanistic studies, with the ultimate goal of identifying biologically sound biomarkers and cardioprotective therapies that allow the optimal use of cancer treatments while minimizing toxicities. Given that novel cancer therapies target specific pathways integral to normal cardiovascular homeostasis, a better mechanistic understanding of toxicity may provide insights into fundamental pathways that lead to cardiovascular disease when dysregulated. The goal of this scientific statement is to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of preclinical models of cancer therapy-associated cardiovascular toxicity, to highlight overlapping mechanisms driving cancer and cardiovascular disease, and to discuss opportunities to leverage cardio-oncology models to address important mechanistic questions relevant to all patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with and without cancer.",2021,Jun 2021,06/25/2021,33934611,PMC8423100,10.1161/RES.0000000000000473,Circulation research,Preclinical Models of Cancer Therapy-Associated Cardiovascular Toxicity: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e21,e34,129,1,"American Heart Association; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cardiotoxicity; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Heart Diseases; Humans; Myocytes, Cardiac; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests; United States",Toxicity Tests,"American Heart Association; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity; Cardiotoxicity; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Heart Diseases/chemically induced, genetics, metabolism, pathology; Humans; Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects, metabolism, pathology; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests; United States","AHA Scientific Statements; cardiotoxicity; heart failure; medical oncology; models, cardiovascular; myocarditis; neoplasms","Journal Article, Review"

As architects of stroke care, neuroscience nurses play a vital role in collaborating and coordinating care between multiple health professionals. Nurses improve accessibility and equity through telestroke, emergency medical services, and mobile stroke units and are integral to implementing education strategies by advocating and ensuring that patients and caregivers receive stroke education while safely transitioning through the health care system and to home. Stroke care is increasingly complex in the new reperfusion era, requiring nurses to participate in continuing education while attaining levels of competency in both the acute and recovery care process. Advanced practice nurses are taking the lead in many organizations, serving as prehospital providers on mobile stroke units, participating as members of the stroke response team, and directing stroke care protocols in the emergency department. This scientific statement is an update to the 2009 ""Comprehensive Overview of Nursing and Interdisciplinary Care of the Acute Ischemic Stroke Patient.""
