Major advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of these infections have occurred since then, necessitating a scientific statement update. An 11-member writing group was identified and included recognized experts in cardiology and infectious diseases, with a career focus on cardiovascular infections. The group initially met in October 2022 to develop a scientific statement that was drafted with front-line clinicians in mind and focused on providing updated clinical information to enhance outcomes of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic device infection. The current scientific statement highlights recent advances in prevention, diagnosis, and management, and how they may be incorporated in the complex care of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic device infection.",2024,Jan 2024,01/09/2024,38047353,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001187,Circulation,"Update on Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Device Infections and Their Prevention, Diagnosis, and Management: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association: Endorsed by the International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases.",e201,e216,149,2,"United States; Humans; American Heart Association; Communicable Diseases; Endocarditis, Bacterial; Cardiovascular Infections; Cardiology; Defibrillators, Implantable","Communicable Diseases; Endocarditis, Bacterial; Cardiovascular Infections; Cardiology; Defibrillators, Implantable","United States; Humans; American Heart Association; Communicable Diseases/diagnosis, epidemiology, therapy; Endocarditis, Bacterial/drug therapy; Cardiovascular Infections; Cardiology; Defibrillators, Implantable/adverse effects","AHA Scientific Statements; defibrillators, implantable; diagnosis; echocardiography, transesophageal; endocarditis; infection","Journal Article, Review"

Moreover, previous observational studies that examined the association of nondental invasive procedures with the risk of infective endocarditis have been limited by inadequate sample size. They have typically focused on a few potential at-risk surgical and nonsurgical invasive procedures. However, recent investigations from Sweden and England that used nationwide databases and demonstrated an association between nondental invasive procedures, and the subsequent development of infective endocarditis (in particular, in high-risk patients with infective endocarditis) prompted the development of the current science advisory.",2023,Nov 2023,11/07/2023,37795631,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001180,Circulation,Nondental Invasive Procedures and Risk of Infective Endocarditis: Time for a Revisit: A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association.,1529,1541,148,19,"United States; Humans; Prospective Studies; American Heart Association; Endocarditis, Bacterial; Endocarditis; Antibiotic Prophylaxis","Endocarditis, Bacterial; Endocarditis","United States; Humans; Prospective Studies; American Heart Association; Endocarditis, Bacterial/prevention & control; Endocarditis/prevention & control; Antibiotic Prophylaxis",AHA Scientific Statements; antibiotic prophylaxis; dental care; endocarditis; surgery,"Journal Article, Review"

The rate of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy has been increasing from approximately 500 cases per 10 000 deliveries in 1993 to 1021 cases per 10 000 deliveries in 2016 to 2017. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Pregnant persons without a known diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy or chronic hypertension. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy with blood pressure measurements has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF recommends screening for hypertensive disorders in pregnant persons with blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy.

We propose that the foundation of treatment of pediatric cardiomyopathies is based on these principles applied as personalized therapy for children with cardiomyopathy: (1) identification of the specific cardiac pathophysiology; (2) determination of the root cause of the cardiomyopathy so that, if applicable, cause-specific treatment can occur (precision medicine); and (3) application of therapies based on the associated clinical milieu of the patient. These clinical milieus include patients at risk for developing cardiomyopathy (cardiomyopathy phenotype negative), asymptomatic patients with cardiomyopathy (phenotype positive), patients with symptomatic cardiomyopathy, and patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy. This scientific statement focuses primarily on the most frequent phenotypes, dilated and hypertrophic, that occur in children. Other less frequent cardiomyopathies, including left ventricular noncompaction, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, are discussed in less detail. Suggestions are based on previous clinical and investigational experience, extrapolating therapies for cardiomyopathies in adults to children and noting the problems and challenges that have arisen in this experience. These likely underscore the increasingly apparent differences in pathogenesis and even pathophysiology in childhood cardiomyopathies compared with adult disease. These differences will likely affect the utility of some adult therapy strategies. Therefore, special emphasis has been placed on cause-specific therapies in children for prevention and attenuation of their cardiomyopathy in addition to symptomatic treatments. Current investigational strategies and treatments not in wide clinical practice, including future direction for investigational management strategies, trial designs, and collaborative networks, are also discussed because they have the potential to further refine and improve the health and outcomes of children with cardiomyopathy in the future.",2023,Jul 2023,07/11/2023,37288568,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001151,Circulation,Treatment Strategies for Cardiomyopathy in Children: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,174,195,148,2,"Humans; American Heart Association; Cardiomyopathies; Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive; Heart Diseases; Phenotype; Child","Cardiomyopathies; Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive; Heart Diseases","Humans; American Heart Association; Cardiomyopathies/diagnosis, therapy, etiology; Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive; Heart Diseases/complications; Phenotype; Child",AHA Scientific Statements; cardiomyopathies; child; heart diseases; precision medicine,"Journal Article, Review"
