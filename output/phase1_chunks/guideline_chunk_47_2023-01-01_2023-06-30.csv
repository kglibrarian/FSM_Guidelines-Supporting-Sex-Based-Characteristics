We propose that the foundation of treatment of pediatric cardiomyopathies is based on these principles applied as personalized therapy for children with cardiomyopathy: (1) identification of the specific cardiac pathophysiology; (2) determination of the root cause of the cardiomyopathy so that, if applicable, cause-specific treatment can occur (precision medicine); and (3) application of therapies based on the associated clinical milieu of the patient. These clinical milieus include patients at risk for developing cardiomyopathy (cardiomyopathy phenotype negative), asymptomatic patients with cardiomyopathy (phenotype positive), patients with symptomatic cardiomyopathy, and patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy. This scientific statement focuses primarily on the most frequent phenotypes, dilated and hypertrophic, that occur in children. Other less frequent cardiomyopathies, including left ventricular noncompaction, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, are discussed in less detail. Suggestions are based on previous clinical and investigational experience, extrapolating therapies for cardiomyopathies in adults to children and noting the problems and challenges that have arisen in this experience. These likely underscore the increasingly apparent differences in pathogenesis and even pathophysiology in childhood cardiomyopathies compared with adult disease. These differences will likely affect the utility of some adult therapy strategies. Therefore, special emphasis has been placed on cause-specific therapies in children for prevention and attenuation of their cardiomyopathy in addition to symptomatic treatments. Current investigational strategies and treatments not in wide clinical practice, including future direction for investigational management strategies, trial designs, and collaborative networks, are also discussed because they have the potential to further refine and improve the health and outcomes of children with cardiomyopathy in the future.",2023,Jul 2023,07/11/2023,37288568,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001151,Circulation,Treatment Strategies for Cardiomyopathy in Children: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,174,195,148,2,"Humans; American Heart Association; Cardiomyopathies; Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive; Heart Diseases; Phenotype; Child","Cardiomyopathies; Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive; Heart Diseases","Humans; American Heart Association; Cardiomyopathies/diagnosis, therapy, etiology; Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive; Heart Diseases/complications; Phenotype; Child",AHA Scientific Statements; cardiomyopathies; child; heart diseases; precision medicine,"Journal Article, Review"

Hypertension, an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is observed in >80% of patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis. The pathophysiology of hypertension in patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis is multifactorial and differs from that seen in other patient populations. Factors that contribute to hypertension in patients treated with hemodialysis include volume overload, arterial stiffness, enhanced activity of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, endothelial dysfunction, and use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents. This scientific statement reviews the current evidence on defining, diagnosing, and treating hypertension in patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis and highlights opportunities for future investigation, including studies on blood pressure targets and treatment strategies.",2023,Jun 2023,,37092336,,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000230,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",Hypertension in Patients Treated With In-Center Maintenance Hemodialysis: Current Evidence and Future Opportunities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e112,e122,80,6,"Humans; United States; Kidney Failure, Chronic; American Heart Association; Hypertension; Renal Dialysis; Blood Pressure","Kidney Failure, Chronic; Hypertension","Humans; United States/epidemiology; Kidney Failure, Chronic; American Heart Association; Hypertension/diagnosis, drug therapy; Renal Dialysis/adverse effects; Blood Pressure",AHA Scientific Statements; hypertension; kidney; renal dialysis; renin-angiotensin system,"Journal Article, Review"

Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery is a distinct type of acute atrial fibrillation. Acute atrial fibrillation is associated with high risk of long-term atrial fibrillation recurrence, warranting clinical attention during acute hospitalization and over long-term follow-up. A framework of substrates and triggers can be useful for evaluating and managing acute atrial fibrillation. Acute management requires a multipronged approach with interdisciplinary care collaboration, tailoring treatments to the patient's underlying substrate and acute condition. Key components of acute management include identification and treatment of triggers, selection and implementation of rate/rhythm control, and management of anticoagulation. Acute rate or rhythm control strategy should be individualized with consideration of the patient's capacity to tolerate rapid rates or atrioventricular dyssynchrony, and the patient's ability to tolerate the risk of the therapeutic strategy. Given the high risks of atrial fibrillation recurrence in patients with acute atrial fibrillation, clinical follow-up and heart rhythm monitoring are warranted. Long-term management is guided by patient substrate, with implications for intensity of heart rhythm monitoring, anticoagulation, and considerations for rhythm management strategies. Overall management of acute atrial fibrillation addresses substrates and triggers. The 3As of acute management are acute triggers, atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management, and anticoagulation. The 2As and 2Ms of long-term management include monitoring of heart rhythm and modification of lifestyle and risk factors, in addition to considerations for atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management and anticoagulation. Several gaps in knowledge related to acute atrial fibrillation exist and warrant future research.",2023,Apr 2023,04/11/2023,36912134,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001133,Circulation,Atrial Fibrillation Occurring During Acute Hospitalization: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e676,e698,147,15,Humans; Atrial Fibrillation; American Heart Association; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; Anticoagulants; Hospitalization; Heart Rate,Atrial Fibrillation,"Humans; Atrial Fibrillation/diagnosis, epidemiology, therapy; American Heart Association; Anti-Arrhythmia Agents/therapeutic use; Anticoagulants/therapeutic use, pharmacology; Hospitalization; Heart Rate",AHA Scientific Statements; atrial fibrillation; critical illness; hospitalization; postoperative period,"Journal Article, Review"

"Cohen JB, Brown NJ, Brown SA, Dent S, van Dorst DCH, Herrmann SM, Lang NN, Oudit GY, Touyz RM, American Heart Association Council on Hypertension; Council on Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology; and Council on the Kidney in Cardiovascular Disease",,,,[''],"Contemporary anticancer drugs have significantly improved cancer survival at the expense of cardiovascular toxicities, including heart disease, thromboembolic disease, and hypertension. One of the most common side effects of these drugs is hypertension, especially in patients treated with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors. Adjunctive therapy, including corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, as well as anti-androgen hormone therapy for prostate cancer, may further increase blood pressure in these patients. Cancer therapy-induced hypertension is often dose limiting, increases cardiovascular mortality in cancer survivors, and is usually reversible after interruption or discontinuation of treatment. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying hypertension are unclear, but recent discoveries indicate an important role for reduced nitric oxide generation, oxidative stress, endothelin-1, prostaglandins, endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic outflow, and microvascular rarefaction. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in vascular endothelial growth factor receptors are implicated in vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor-induced hypertension. Diagnosis, management, and follow-up of cancer therapy-induced hypertension follow national hypertension guidelines because evidence-based clinical trials specifically addressing patients who develop hypertension as a result of cancer therapy are currently lacking. Rigorous baseline assessment of patients before therapy is started requires particular emphasis on assessing and treating cardiovascular risk factors. Hypertension management follows guidelines for the general population, although special attention should be given to rebound hypotension after termination of cancer therapy. Management of these complex patients requires collaborative care involving oncologists, cardiologists, hypertension specialists, primary care professionals, and pharmacists to ensure the optimal therapeutic effect from cancer treatment while minimizing competing cardiovascular toxicities.",2023,Mar 2023,,36621810,PMC10602651,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000224,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",Cancer Therapy-Related Hypertension: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e46,e57,80,3,Male; Humans; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; American Heart Association; Hypertension; Antineoplastic Agents; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Neoplasms,Hypertension; Antineoplastic Agents; Neoplasms,"Male; Humans; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; American Heart Association; Hypertension/chemically induced, drug therapy; Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects; Angiogenesis Inhibitors/adverse effects; Neoplasms/drug therapy",AHA Scientific Statements; angiogenesis inhibitors; blood pressure; cancer therapy; cardiotoxicity; chemically induced hypertension; hypertension management,"Journal Article, Review"

Both age-related physiological changes and accumulated cardiovascular risk factors increase the susceptibility to acute coronary syndrome over a lifetime. Compared with younger patients, outcomes for acute coronary syndrome in the large and growing demographic of older adults are relatively worse. Increased atherosclerotic plaque burden and complexity of anatomic disease, compounded by age-related cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbid conditions, contribute to the worse prognosis observed in older individuals. Geriatric syndromes, including frailty, multimorbidity, impaired cognitive and physical function, polypharmacy, and other complexities of care, can undermine the therapeutic efficacy of guidelines-based treatments and the resiliency of older adults to survive and recover, as well. In this American Heart Association scientific statement, we (1) review age-related physiological changes that predispose to acute coronary syndrome and management complexity; (2) describe the influence of commonly encountered geriatric syndromes on cardiovascular disease outcomes; and (3) recommend age-appropriate and guideline-concordant revascularization and acute coronary syndrome management strategies, including transitions of care, the use of cardiac rehabilitation, palliative care services, and holistic approaches.
