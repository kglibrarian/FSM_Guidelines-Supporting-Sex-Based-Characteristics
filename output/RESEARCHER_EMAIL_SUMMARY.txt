EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We analyzed 75 clinical practice guidelines and their cited evidence to assess sex and gender consideration in medical research. Our pipeline processed 9,378 references, identified 1,408 clinical trials, and comprehensively analyzed sex consideration across multiple dimensions.

Key Finding: Only 29.6% of guideline-cited trials explicitly consider sex/gender in their analysis, with substantial variation across guidelines (0.0% to 100.0%).

We analyzed 75 clinical practice guidelines and the clinical trials cited as supporting evidence to assess how sex and sex-related characteristics are represented in the research informing guideline recommendations. Across 1,408 unique clinical trials (1,527 total trial citations), 417 trials (29.6%) included explicit consideration of sex or sex-related factors in eligibility criteria, analysis, or reporting. Consideration varied substantially across guidelines, ranging from 0.0% to 100.0% of cited trials per guideline, indicating uneven incorporation of sex-related evidence across clinical domains.

We also examined trial registration and reporting context. Of the cited trials, 400 (28.4%) could be linked to a ClinicalTrials.gov registry record, while 1,008 (71.6%) could not. Registered trials were more likely to document sex eligibility and related characteristics, suggesting registry linkage may support greater transparency in sex-related reporting. These findings are intended to provide descriptive insight into the evidence base underlying current guidelines and to support ongoing discussions around trial design, reporting practices, and guideline development.

COMPLETE PIPELINE OVERVIEW
PHASE-BY-PHASE DATA FLOW

PHASE 1: PubMed Guidelines Collection
Purpose: Identify clinical practice guidelines published 2019-2024

Method:
