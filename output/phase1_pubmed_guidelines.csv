This advisory was developed after a review of human studies on the relationship of dietary cholesterol with blood lipids, lipoproteins, and cardiovascular disease risk to address questions about the relevance of dietary cholesterol guidance for heart health. Evidence from observational studies conducted in several countries generally does not indicate a significant association with cardiovascular disease risk. Although meta-analyses of intervention studies differ in their findings, most associate intakes of cholesterol that exceed current average levels with elevated total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Dietary guidance should focus on healthy dietary patterns (eg, Mediterranean-style and DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]-style diets) that are inherently relatively low in cholesterol with typical levels similar to the current US intake. These patterns emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, lean protein sources, nuts, seeds, and liquid vegetable oils. A recommendation that gives a specific dietary cholesterol target within the context of food-based advice is challenging for clinicians and consumers to implement; hence, guidance focused on dietary patterns is more likely to improve diet quality and to promote cardiovascular health.",2020,Jan 2020,01/21/2020,31838890,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000743,Circulation,Dietary Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Risk: A Science Advisory From the American Heart Association.,e39,e53,141.0,3,"Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol, Dietary; Diet, Western; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Recommended Dietary Allowances","Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol, Dietary; Diet, Western; Nutrition Policy; Recommended Dietary Allowances","Cardiovascular Diseases/blood, etiology, prevention & control; Cholesterol, Dietary/administration & dosage, adverse effects; Diet, Western; Humans; Nutrition Policy; Recommended Dietary Allowances",AHA Scientific Statements; cholesterol; diet; eggs; risk factors,"Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Systematic Review"

Older adults with cardiovascular disease are frequently admitted to cardiac intensive care units (CICUs), where care is commensurate with high age-related cardiovascular disease risks but where the associated geriatric conditions (including multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive decline and delirium, and frailty) may be inadvertently exacerbated and destabilized. The CICU environment of procedures, new medications, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, prolonged bed rest, malnourishment, and sleep is usually inherently disruptive to older patients regardless of the excellence of cardiovascular disease care. Given these fundamental and broad challenges of patient aging, CICU management priorities and associated decision-making are particularly complex and in need of enhancements. In this American Heart Association statement, we examine age-related risks and describe some of the distinctive dynamics pertinent to older adults and emerging opportunities to enhance CICU care. Relevant assessment tools are discussed, as well as the need for additional clinical research to best advance CICU care for the already dominating and still expanding population of older adults.",2020,Jan 2020,01/14/2020,31813278,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000000741,Circulation,"Older Adults in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit: Factoring Geriatric Syndromes in the Management, Prognosis, and Process of Care: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.",e6,e32,141.0,2,Aged; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases; Decision Making; Delirium; Disease Management; Energy Intake; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Middle Aged; Multimorbidity; Polypharmacy; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Transitional Care; United States,Geriatric Assessment,"Aged; American Heart Association; Cardiovascular Diseases/pathology, therapy; Decision Making; Delirium/pathology; Disease Management; Energy Intake; Frailty; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Middle Aged; Multimorbidity; Polypharmacy; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Transitional Care; United States",AHA Scientific Statements; aged; aging; bed rest; cardiovascular diseases; cognition; confusion; decision making; delirium; dementia; frailty; multimorbidity; polypharmacy; resuscitation orders; sarcopenia,Journal Article

Over the past 50 years, the prevalence of CVD has been rising among American Indians and Alaska Natives. The objective of this statement is to summarize population-level risk factors and management techniques tailored for the American Indian and Alaska Native populations. PubMed/MEDLINE, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the annual Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics report from the American Heart Association were used to identify risk factors and interventions specific to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Diabetes mellitus is a major contributor to disproportionately higher rates of coronary heart disease among American Indians and Alaska Natives compared with other racial and ethnic groups. Additional risk factors for CVD include low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, hypertension, renal disease, age, and sex. Smoking and exposure to toxic metals are risk factors for some subpopulations. A quarter of American Indians live below the federal poverty line, and thus, low socioeconomic status is an important social determinant of cardiovascular health. Community-based interventions have reduced CVD risk in American Indians and Alaska Natives. Underreporting of American Indian and Alaska Native race could underestimate the extent of CVD in this population. Prevention and treatment of CVD in American Indians and Alaska Natives should focus on control of risk factors and community-based interventions that address social determinants of health, particularly among individuals with diabetes mellitus.

,,,,,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy constitute one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality worldwide. It has been estimated that preeclampsia complicates 2-8% of pregnancies globally (). In Latin America and the Caribbean, hypertensive disorders are responsible for almost 26% of maternal deaths, whereas in Africa and Asia they contribute to 9% of deaths. Although maternal mortality is much lower in high-income countries than in developing countries, 16% of maternal deaths can be attributed to hypertensive disorders (). In the United States, the rate of preeclampsia increased by 25% between 1987 and 2004 (). Moreover, in comparison with women giving birth in 1980, those giving birth in 2003 were at 6.7-fold increased risk of severe preeclampsia (). This complication is costly: one study reported that in 2012 in the United States, the estimated cost of preeclampsia within the first 12 months of delivery was $2.18 billion ($1.03 billion for women and $1.15 billion for infants), which was disproportionately borne by premature births ().

Great strides have been made in stroke prevention and rhythm control strategies, yet reducing the incidence of AF has been slowed by the increasing incidence and prevalence of AF risk factors, including obesity, physical inactivity, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other modifiable lifestyle-related factors. Fortunately, many of these AF drivers are potentially reversible, and emerging evidence supports that addressing these modifiable risks may be effective for primary and secondary AF prevention. A structured, protocol-driven multidisciplinary approach to integrate lifestyle and risk factor management as an integral part of AF management may help in the prevention and treatment of AF. However, this aspect of AF management is currently underrecognized, underused, and understudied. The purpose of this American Heart Association scientific statement is to review the association of modifiable risk factors with AF and the effects of risk factor intervention.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and multiple others have been reminders that structural racism persists and restricts the opportunities for long, healthy lives of Black Americans and other historically disenfranchised groups. The American Heart Association has previously published statements addressing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk and disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the United States, but these statements have not adequately recognized structural racism as a fundamental cause of poor health and disparities in cardiovascular disease. This presidential advisory reviews the historical context, current state, and potential solutions to address structural racism in our country. Several principles emerge from our review: racism persists; racism is experienced; and the task of dismantling racism must belong to all of society. It cannot be accomplished by affected individuals alone. The path forward requires our commitment to transforming the conditions of historically marginalized communities, improving the quality of housing and neighborhood environments of these populations, advocating for policies that eliminate inequities in access to economic opportunities, quality education, and health care, and enhancing allyship among racial and ethnic groups. Future research on racism must be accelerated and should investigate the joint effects of multiple domains of racism (structural, interpersonal, cultural, anti-Black). The American Heart Association must look internally to correct its own shortcomings and advance antiracist policies and practices regarding science, public and professional education, and advocacy.

At the human level (T1), new methods for diagnosing, treating, and preventing venous thromboembolism will allow tailoring of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to individuals. At the patient level (T2), research efforts are required to understand how foundational evidence impacts care of patients (eg, biomarkers). New treatments, such as catheter-based therapies, require further testing to identify which patients are most likely to experience benefit. At the practice level (T3), translating evidence into practice remains challenging. Areas of overuse and underuse will require evidence-based tools to improve care delivery.

The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association convened an evidence review committee to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of DAPT compared with SAPT for secondary ischemic stroke prevention. The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on December 5, 2019, to identify phase III or IV randomized controlled trials (n≥100) from December 1999 to December 2019. We calculated unadjusted relative risks (RRs) and performed meta-analyses of studies based on the duration of treatment (short [≤90 days] versus long [>90 days]). Three short-duration randomized controlled trials were identified that enrolled mostly patients with minor stroke or high risk transient ischemic attack. In these trials, DAPT, compared with SAPT, was associated with a lower 90-day risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55-0.83], <i>I </i><sup>2</sup>=37.1%).

Cardiovascular toxicity associated with cancer therapy can manifest as a broad range of potentially life-threatening complications, including heart failure, arrhythmia, myocarditis, and vascular events. Beyond toxicology, the intersection of cancer and heart disease has blossomed to include discovery of genetic and environmental risk factors that predispose to both. There is a pressing need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity to improve outcomes in patients with cancer. Preclinical cardiovascular models, ranging from cellular assays to large animals, serve as the foundation for mechanistic studies, with the ultimate goal of identifying biologically sound biomarkers and cardioprotective therapies that allow the optimal use of cancer treatments while minimizing toxicities. Given that novel cancer therapies target specific pathways integral to normal cardiovascular homeostasis, a better mechanistic understanding of toxicity may provide insights into fundamental pathways that lead to cardiovascular disease when dysregulated. The goal of this scientific statement is to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of preclinical models of cancer therapy-associated cardiovascular toxicity, to highlight overlapping mechanisms driving cancer and cardiovascular disease, and to discuss opportunities to leverage cardio-oncology models to address important mechanistic questions relevant to all patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with and without cancer.",2021,Jun 2021,06/25/2021,33934611,PMC8423100,10.1161/RES.0000000000000473,Circulation research,Preclinical Models of Cancer Therapy-Associated Cardiovascular Toxicity: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e21,e34,129.0,1,"American Heart Association; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cardiotoxicity; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Heart Diseases; Humans; Myocytes, Cardiac; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests; United States",Toxicity Tests,"American Heart Association; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity; Cardiotoxicity; Cells, Cultured; Disease Models, Animal; Heart Diseases/chemically induced, genetics, metabolism, pathology; Humans; Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects, metabolism, pathology; Risk Assessment; Toxicity Tests; United States","AHA Scientific Statements; cardiotoxicity; heart failure; medical oncology; models, cardiovascular; myocarditis; neoplasms","Journal Article, Review"

However, several prospective, randomized trials for atherosclerotic disease failed to demonstrate that renal revascularization is more effective than medical therapy for most patients. These results have greatly reduced the generalized diagnostic workup and use of renal revascularization. Most guidelines and review articles emphasize the limited average improvement and fail to identify those clinical populations that do benefit from revascularization. On the basis of the clinical experience of hypertension centers, specialists have continued selective revascularization, albeit without a summary statement by a major, multidisciplinary, national organization that identifies specific populations that may benefit. In this scientific statement for health care professionals and the public-at-large, we review the strengths and weaknesses of randomized trials in revascularization and highlight (1) when referral for consideration of diagnostic workup and therapy may be warranted, (2) the evidence/rationale for these selective scenarios, (3) interventional and surgical techniques for effective revascularization, and (4) areas of research with unmet need.",2022,Aug 2022,,35708012,PMC11731842,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000217,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",Revascularization for Renovascular Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e128,e143,79.0,8,"American Heart Association; Humans; Hypertension; Hypertension, Renovascular; Prospective Studies; Renal Artery Obstruction; Vascular Surgical Procedures","Hypertension; Hypertension, Renovascular; Renal Artery Obstruction","American Heart Association; Humans; Hypertension; Hypertension, Renovascular/diagnosis, etiology, surgery; Prospective Studies; Renal Artery Obstruction/diagnosis, surgery; Vascular Surgical Procedures","AHA Scientific Statements; heart failure; hypertension, renovascular; renal artery obstruction","Journal Article, Review"

However, the percentage of cases in which an individual receives bystander CPR is actually low, at only 35% to 40% globally. Preparing lay responders to recognize the signs of sudden cardiac arrest, call 9-1-1, and perform CPR in public and private locations is crucial to increasing survival from this public health problem. The objective of this scientific statement is to summarize the most recent published evidence about the lay responder experience of training, responding, and dealing with the residual impact of witnessing an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The scientific statement focuses on the experience-based literature of actual responders, which includes barriers to responding, experiences of doing CPR, use of an automated external defibrillator, the impact of dispatcher-assisted CPR, and the potential for postevent psychological sequelae. The large body of qualitative and observational studies identifies several gaps in crucial knowledge that, if targeted, could increase the likelihood that those who are trained in CPR will act.

Increased atherosclerotic plaque burden and complexity of anatomic disease, compounded by age-related cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbid conditions, contribute to the worse prognosis observed in older individuals. Geriatric syndromes, including frailty, multimorbidity, impaired cognitive and physical function, polypharmacy, and other complexities of care, can undermine the therapeutic efficacy of guidelines-based treatments and the resiliency of older adults to survive and recover, as well.

In this scientific statement, we review evidence from the past decade related to coronary heart disease screening and management for kidney and liver transplantation candidates. Coronary heart disease screening in asymptomatic kidney and liver transplantation candidates has not been demonstrated to improve outcomes but is common in practice. Risk stratification algorithms based on the presence or absence of clinical risk factors and physical performance have been proposed, but a high proportion of candidates still meet criteria for screening tests. We suggest new approaches to pretransplantation evaluation grounded on the presence or absence of known coronary heart disease and cardiac symptoms and emphasize multidisciplinary engagement, including involvement of a dedicated cardiologist. Noninvasive functional screening methods such as stress echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy have limited accuracy, and newer noninvasive modalities, especially cardiac computed tomography-based tests, are promising alternatives. Emerging evidence such as results of the 2020 International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease trial emphasizes the vital importance of guideline-directed medical therapy in managing diagnosed coronary heart disease and further questions the value of revascularization among asymptomatic kidney transplantation candidates.

Preventive measures are critical in people who inject drugs and are cured of an initial bout of infective endocarditis because they remain at extremely high risk for subsequent bouts of infective endocarditis, regardless of whether injection drug use is continued.",2022,Oct 2022,10/04/2022,36043414,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001090,Circulation,Management of Infective Endocarditis in People Who Inject Drugs: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e187,e201,146.0,14,"American Heart Association; Drug Users; Endocarditis; Endocarditis, Bacterial; Humans","Drug Users; Endocarditis; Endocarditis, Bacterial","American Heart Association; Drug Users; Endocarditis/diagnosis, drug therapy, etiology; Endocarditis, Bacterial/drug therapy; Humans","AHA Scientific Statements; addiction medicine; cardiology; communicable diseases; endocarditis; injections; substance abuse, intravenous","Journal Article, Review"

Objective To review observational and intervention research that examines the impact of social isolation and loneliness on cardiovascular and brain health and discuss proposed mechanisms for observed associations. Methods We conducted a systematic scoping review of available research. We searched 4 databases, PubMed, PsycInfo, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, and Scopus. Findings Evidence is most consistent for a direct association between social isolation, loneliness, and coronary heart disease and stroke mortality. However, data on the association between social isolation and loneliness with heart failure, dementia, and cognitive impairment are sparse and less robust. Few studies have empirically tested mediating pathways between social isolation, loneliness, and cardiovascular and brain health outcomes using appropriate methods for explanatory analyses. Notably, the effect estimates are small, and there may be unmeasured confounders of the associations. Research in groups that may be at higher risk or more vulnerable to the effects of social isolation is limited. We did not find any intervention studies that sought to reduce the adverse impact of social isolation or loneliness on cardiovascular or brain health outcomes. Conclusions Social isolation and loneliness are common and appear to be independent risk factors for worse cardiovascular and brain health; however, consistency of the associations varies by outcome. There is a need to develop, implement, and test interventions to improve cardiovascular and brain health for individuals who are socially isolated or lonely.",2022,Aug 2022,08/16/2022,35924775,PMC9496293,10.1161/JAHA.122.026493,Journal of the American Heart Association,Effects of Objective and Perceived Social Isolation on Cardiovascular and Brain Health: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e026493,e026493,11.0,16,American Heart Association; Brain; Humans; Loneliness; Risk Factors; Social Isolation,American Heart Association; Social Isolation,American Heart Association; Brain; Humans; Loneliness/psychology; Risk Factors; Social Isolation/psychology,AHA Scientific Statements; brain health; cardiovascular health; loneliness; social isolation,"Journal Article, Systematic Review"

We propose that the foundation of treatment of pediatric cardiomyopathies is based on these principles applied as personalized therapy for children with cardiomyopathy: (1) identification of the specific cardiac pathophysiology; (2) determination of the root cause of the cardiomyopathy so that, if applicable, cause-specific treatment can occur (precision medicine); and (3) application of therapies based on the associated clinical milieu of the patient. These clinical milieus include patients at risk for developing cardiomyopathy (cardiomyopathy phenotype negative), asymptomatic patients with cardiomyopathy (phenotype positive), patients with symptomatic cardiomyopathy, and patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy. This scientific statement focuses primarily on the most frequent phenotypes, dilated and hypertrophic, that occur in children. Other less frequent cardiomyopathies, including left ventricular noncompaction, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, are discussed in less detail. Suggestions are based on previous clinical and investigational experience, extrapolating therapies for cardiomyopathies in adults to children and noting the problems and challenges that have arisen in this experience. These likely underscore the increasingly apparent differences in pathogenesis and even pathophysiology in childhood cardiomyopathies compared with adult disease. These differences will likely affect the utility of some adult therapy strategies. Therefore, special emphasis has been placed on cause-specific therapies in children for prevention and attenuation of their cardiomyopathy in addition to symptomatic treatments. Current investigational strategies and treatments not in wide clinical practice, including future direction for investigational management strategies, trial designs, and collaborative networks, are also discussed because they have the potential to further refine and improve the health and outcomes of children with cardiomyopathy in the future.",2023,Jul 2023,07/11/2023,37288568,,10.1161/CIR.0000000000001151,Circulation,Treatment Strategies for Cardiomyopathy in Children: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,174,195,148.0,2,"Humans; American Heart Association; Cardiomyopathies; Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive; Heart Diseases; Phenotype; Child","Cardiomyopathies; Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive; Heart Diseases","Humans; American Heart Association; Cardiomyopathies/diagnosis, therapy, etiology; Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive; Heart Diseases/complications; Phenotype; Child",AHA Scientific Statements; cardiomyopathies; child; heart diseases; precision medicine,"Journal Article, Review"

Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery is a distinct type of acute atrial fibrillation. Acute atrial fibrillation is associated with high risk of long-term atrial fibrillation recurrence, warranting clinical attention during acute hospitalization and over long-term follow-up. A framework of substrates and triggers can be useful for evaluating and managing acute atrial fibrillation. Acute management requires a multipronged approach with interdisciplinary care collaboration, tailoring treatments to the patient's underlying substrate and acute condition. Key components of acute management include identification and treatment of triggers, selection and implementation of rate/rhythm control, and management of anticoagulation. Acute rate or rhythm control strategy should be individualized with consideration of the patient's capacity to tolerate rapid rates or atrioventricular dyssynchrony, and the patient's ability to tolerate the risk of the therapeutic strategy. Given the high risks of atrial fibrillation recurrence in patients with acute atrial fibrillation, clinical follow-up and heart rhythm monitoring are warranted. Long-term management is guided by patient substrate, with implications for intensity of heart rhythm monitoring, anticoagulation, and considerations for rhythm management strategies. Overall management of acute atrial fibrillation addresses substrates and triggers. The 3As of acute management are acute triggers, atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management, and anticoagulation. The 2As and 2Ms of long-term management include monitoring of heart rhythm and modification of lifestyle and risk factors, in addition to considerations for atrial fibrillation rate/rhythm management and anticoagulation.

One of the most common side effects of these drugs is hypertension, especially in patients treated with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors. Adjunctive therapy, including corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, as well as anti-androgen hormone therapy for prostate cancer, may further increase blood pressure in these patients. Cancer therapy-induced hypertension is often dose limiting, increases cardiovascular mortality in cancer survivors, and is usually reversible after interruption or discontinuation of treatment. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying hypertension are unclear, but recent discoveries indicate an important role for reduced nitric oxide generation, oxidative stress, endothelin-1, prostaglandins, endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic outflow, and microvascular rarefaction. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in vascular endothelial growth factor receptors are implicated in vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor-induced hypertension. Diagnosis, management, and follow-up of cancer therapy-induced hypertension follow national hypertension guidelines because evidence-based clinical trials specifically addressing patients who develop hypertension as a result of cancer therapy are currently lacking. Rigorous baseline assessment of patients before therapy is started requires particular emphasis on assessing and treating cardiovascular risk factors. Hypertension management follows guidelines for the general population, although special attention should be given to rebound hypotension after termination of cancer therapy. Management of these complex patients requires collaborative care involving oncologists, cardiologists, hypertension specialists, primary care professionals, and pharmacists to ensure the optimal therapeutic effect from cancer treatment while minimizing competing cardiovascular toxicities.",2023,Mar 2023,,36621810,PMC10602651,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000224,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",Cancer Therapy-Related Hypertension: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.,e46,e57,80.0,3,Male; Humans; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; American Heart Association; Hypertension; Antineoplastic Agents; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Neoplasms,Hypertension; Antineoplastic Agents; Neoplasms,"Male; Humans; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; American Heart Association; Hypertension/chemically induced, drug therapy; Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects; Angiogenesis Inhibitors/adverse effects; Neoplasms/drug therapy",AHA Scientific Statements; angiogenesis inhibitors; blood pressure; cancer therapy; cardiotoxicity; chemically induced hypertension; hypertension management,"Journal Article, Review"

In contrast, there is a lack of comparable evidence for guiding the management of elevated BP in the acute care setting, resulting in significant practice variation. Throughout this scientific statement, we use the terms acute care and inpatient to refer to care received in the emergency department and after admission to the hospital. Elevated inpatient BP is common and can manifest either as asymptomatic or with signs of new or worsening target-organ damage, a condition referred to as hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency involves acute target-organ damage and should be treated swiftly, usually with intravenous antihypertensive medications, in a closely monitored setting. However, the risk-benefit ratio of initiating or intensifying antihypertensive medications for asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP is less clear. Despite this ambiguity, clinicians prescribe oral or intravenous antihypertensive medications in approximately one-third of cases of asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP. Recent observational studies have suggested potential harms associated with treating asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP, which brings current practice into question. Despite the ubiquity of elevated inpatient BPs, few position papers, guidelines, or consensus statements have focused on improving BP management in the acute care setting.

Hypertension detection, treatment, and control vary worldwide; it is still low, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). High blood pressure (BP) and CVD risk have a strong, linear, and independent association. They contribute to alarming numbers of all-cause and CVD deaths. A major culprit for increased hypertension is sympathetic activity, and further complications of hypertension are heart failure, ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, and renal failure. Now, antihypertensive interventions have emerged as a global public health priority to reduce BP-related morbidity and mortality. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are highly effective vasodilators. and the most common drugs used for managing hypertension and CVD. Cilnidipine, with both L- and N-type calcium channel blocking activity, is a promising 4th generation CCB. It causes vasodilation via L-type calcium channel blockade and inhibits the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) via N-type calcium channel blockade. Cilnidipine, which acts as a dual L/N-type CCB, is linked to a reduced occurrence of pedal edema compared to amlodipine, which solely blocks L-type calcium channels. The antihypertensive properties of cilnidipine are very substantial, with low BP variability and long-acting properties. It is beneficial for hypertensive patients to deal with morning hypertension and for patients with abnormal nocturnal BP due to exaggerated sympathetic nerve activation. Besides its BP-lowering effect, it also exhibits organ protection via sympathetic nerve inhibition and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition; it controls heart rate and proteinuria. Reno-protective, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects of cilnidipine have been well-documented and demonstrated.",2024,Jan 2024,,38736080,,10.59556/japi.71.0400,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,"The Promise of Cilnidipine in Hypertension with Comorbidities: National Consensus Statement: National Consensus Group Comprises Cardiologists, Nephrologists, and Diabetologists from India in a National Meet at New Delhi held on 22<sup>nd</sup> May 2022.",88,95,72.0,1,Humans; Hypertension; Calcium Channel Blockers; Dihydropyridines; India; Antihypertensive Agents; Consensus; Comorbidity,Hypertension; Calcium Channel Blockers; Dihydropyridines,Humans; Hypertension/drug therapy; Calcium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use; Dihydropyridines/therapeutic use; India/epidemiology; Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use; Consensus; Comorbidity,,"Journal Article, Consensus Development Conference"

Although previously considered a rare disease, increased awareness and noninvasive diagnostic methods have resulted in a rise in diagnoses. As a multisystem disease that affects multiple organ systems (cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, and neurological), there is significant overlap with both geriatric conditions and common conditions in heart failure. Frailty is recognized as a distinct biological syndrome of declines across multiple physiological systems, which prevents maintenance of homeostasis and limits the ability to respond to stressors. Frailty was initially characterized as physical frailty alone; however, it is increasingly recognized that it is multidimensional with components including nutrition, cognitive, psychological, and social. Frailty in cardiovascular disease has become an important risk factor, indicator for disease severity, and can help guide decisions around intervention. In certain patients, frailty may be reversible. Given the lack of consensus definitions, tools, and implementation of frailty in both clinical and research settings in the field of amyloidosis, we convened a group of experts from cardiology, geriatric cardiology, geriatrics, hematology, and allied health to form this state-of-the-art review. There are many points of intersectionality between amyloidosis, aging, and frailty which herald a need for multidisciplinary care.

Despite technical advances in care that may be offered, many critically ill cardiovascular patients will nevertheless experience significant morbidity and mortality during the acute decompensation, including physical and psychological suffering. Palliative care, with its specialized focus on alleviating suffering, aligns treatments with patient and caregiver values and improves overall care planning. Integrating palliative care into cardiovascular disease management extends the therapeutic approach beyond life-sustaining measures to encompass life-enhancing goals, addressing the physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual needs of critically ill patients.

Because these patients are living longer, treatment and disease surveillance targets have shifted toward enhancing quality of life and functional status. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a valuable tool for assessing functional capacity, evaluating cardiac and pulmonary pathology, and providing guidance on prognosis and interventional recommendations. Despite the extensive evidence supporting the ability of cardiopulmonary exercise testing to quantitatively evaluate cardiovascular function, there remains confusion on how to properly interpret cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with congenital heart disease. The purpose of this statement is to provide a lifespan approach to the interpretation of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with congenital heart disease. This is an updated report of the American Heart Association's previous publications on exercise in children. This evidence-based update on the significance of cardiopulmonary exercise testing findings in pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with various congenital cardiac pathologies and surgically modified physiology is formatted in a way to guide cardiopulmonary exercise testing interpretation practically for the clinicians and exercise physiologists who care for patients with congenital heart disease. Focus is placed on the indications for exercise testing, expected findings, and how exercise testing should guide the management of patients with various congenital heart disease subtypes.
